Summary of History
</h2>

<p>    
The Royal Scots Fusiliers, the 21<sup>st</sup> Foot, were raised in 1678 by the 5th Earl
of Mar in response
to internal instability in Scotland. 
Mar’s Regiment quickly gained the distinction of becoming a Fusilier Regiment and by 1695 was 
officially known as the Scots Fusiliers. 
The distinction of Fusilier derived from those elite troops armed with the new flintlock musket known 
as a ‘Fusil’. 
The Regiment achieved Royal status in 1712. 
Among the Regiment’s nicknames, the most treasured was that of ‘Marlborough’s Own’ gained following 
10 years of distinguished service under the Duke of Marlborough (1702 - 1712). 
During this time the Regiment fought in the great battles of Blenheim and Ramillies amongst others.
</p>

<p>
At the Cardwell reforms of 1881 the Regiment became officially the County Regiment of Ayrshire in 
South West Scotland. 
Unlike the Highland Light Infantry this reform did not lead to amalgamation as the 21<sup>st</sup> already 
possessed two battalions
</p>

<p>
The next major reform of the infantry came in 1957 when thirty Regiments amalgamated into fifteen pairs. 
The Royal Scots Fusiliers and Highland Light Infantry were selected for amalgamation and this 
officially took place in Edinburgh on 20<sup>th</sup> January 1959. 
The new Regiment was titled The Royal Highland Fusiliers (Princess Margaret’s Own Glasgow and 
Ayrshire Regiment).
</p>

<p>
In honour of both Regiments, the Royal Highland Fusiliers still wear the Highland Light Infantry’s 
Mackenzie tartan trews (trousers) and retain the Flaming Grenade cap badge from the Royal Scots
Fusiliers.
