Origins - 1678 to 1689
</h3>

<p>
The Royal Scots Fusiliers, the 21<sup>st</sup> Foot, was raised in 1678 by the 5th Earl
of Mar in response
to internal instability in Scotland.
During the period 1678-87 the 21<sup>st</sup>  was employed in keeping the peace in Scotland and suppressing 
lawlessness by Highlanders and Covenanters.
</p>     

<p>
When William of Orange landed in Britain, the 21<sup>st</sup> crossed the border into England on the orders 
of James II who was concentrating his army near London, to resist William. 
However James fled to France and the army declared for William.
</p>

 European Wars And Jacobite Revolutions - 1689 to 1775 
</h3>

<p>From 1689-96 the 21<sup>st</sup> formed part of the allied force opposing Louis XIV in defence of the 
Low Countries. It fought at Walcourt 1689, Steenkirk 1692, Landen 1693. 
In these battles the reputation of the British Infantry was first established.
</p>

<p>
In about 1689 or 1690 the 21<sup>st</sup> was designated a Fusilier regiment, the name coming from the 
Fusil or lightweight flintlock musket recently issued to certain regiments. The
first written record is a muster-roll of the army in Flanders, dated July 1691, in which the 
21<sup>st</sup> is named as ‘O’Farrell’s Fusiliers’, Francis Fergus O’Farrell then being Colonel. 
A Royal Warrant of 30th December 1695 names the regiment as ‘Scots Fusiliers’.
</p>

<p>
From 1697 to 1701 the 21<sup>st</sup> was quartered in Scotland but it was soon back in the 
Low Countries taking part, from 1702 to 1712, in the War of the Spanish Succession.
Here it served under Marlborough, taking part in the battles of Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), 
Oudenarde (1708), Malplaquet (1709), Bouchain (1711) and many others, being in the field 
throughout the whole 10 year campaign.
As a result it was granted the prefix ‘Royal’, and became known as ‘Marlborough’s Own’.
</p>

<p>
The 21<sup>st</sup> returned to Scotland in 1715 as a result of the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion and there 
took part in the Battle of Sheriffmuir.
</p>

<p>
Following the defeat of the 1715 Rebellion, the period of peace from 1716 to 1741 
saw the 21<sup>st</sup> quartered in Scotland, Ireland and England. 
</p>

<p>
This was to end in 1742 with its return to the Netherlands on the outbreak of the War of 
the Austrian Succession.
In this war it took a distinguished part in the battles of Dettingen, in 1743, and of Fontenoy
in 1745.
</p>

<p>
The Second Jacobite Rebellion of 1745 resulted in the 21<sup>st</sup>'s temporary recall back to 
Scotland in 1746 where it fought at Drumossie Moor, or Culloden as it is now known.
</p>

<p>1747 saw the 21<sup>st</sup> again in the Netherlands where it was involved in action at the 
Battle of Lauffeld.
Following the Peace Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle which ended the War, the 21<sup>st</sup> returned to 
England in 1748.
</p>



<p>
Two years in England were followed by Garrison Duty in Gibraltar before returning to England in 1760.
</p>

<p>
Its next overseas action was in the Seven Years War in which it took part in the assault landing and
capture of Belle Isle, Bay of Biscay.
</p>

<p>
The period from 1762-75 saw the 21<sup>st</sup> serving on Garrison Duties in Scotland, 1762-64, 
Florida, 1765-69, Canada, 1770-71, and England, 1772-75.

The American and Napoleonic Wars - 1775 to 1815
</h3>

<p>
Following the start of the American Revolution, the 21<sup>st</sup> embarked for 
North America to take part in the relief of Quebec (1776). 
Subsequently it took part in battles of Stillwater (1777) and Saratoga (1777).
After Saratoga it returned to Britain to be reformed and then was stationed in Scotland and 
Ireland from 1780 to 1788.
</p>

<p>
1789 saw the 21<sup>st</sup> return to North America where it carried out Garrison duties in Nova Scotia,
North America and the West Indies.
In 1794 it was in action against the French at the captures of Martinique, Guadeloupe
and Fort Matilda.
In addition to any losses which may have arisen in action in the West Indies, in 1795 the strength of the
21<sup>st</sup> was greatly reduced by Yellow Fever.
</p>

<p>
The depleted 21<sup>st</sup> returned to Scotland 1797 and from 1797 to 1805 was
stationed in Scotland, 
Ireland and England. 
In 1804 it became the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion of the 21<sup>st</sup>(1/21<sup>st</sup>), 
when a 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion was raised.
</p>

<p>
When the Napoleonic Wars started in 1806 the 1/21<sup>st</sup>  was sent to Sicily to
protect the island against the French. It joined the expedition to Egypt in 1807, fought in Italy (1809)
and repulsed French attacks on Sicily in 1810. 
A grenadier company of the 1/21<sup>st</sup> landed at Alicante, Spain in 1811 and 
two companies landed on the island of Ponza in 1813.
After advancing through Italy the 1/21<sup>st</sup>  was present at the fall of Genoa 1814.
</p>

<p>
After the fall of Genoa, the 1/21st was sent to America and was part of the force which defeated 
American troops at Bladensburg in 1814 and entered Washington, where the Regiment ate the 
Presidential banquet prepared to celebrate its defeat. 
Later the 21st was in action at Baltimore (1814) and New Orleans (1815). It then returned to Europe, 
joining Wellington’s Army, after peace was declared in 1815.

The Long Peace - 1815 to 1853
</h3>

<p>
The forty years between Waterloo and the Crimea were known as ‘the long peace’ but this did not mean that
times were peaceful for the 1/21<sup>st</sup>. There were riots in England, rebellion in Ireland and 
the British Empire required considerable attention. 
During this period, the Regiment served with the Army of Occupation in France during 1816, in 
England during 1817 to 1818, the West Indies, 1819 to 1826, and England and Ireland, 1827 to 1832.
From 1833 to 1838 it was in Australia, in charge of convicts, followed by a tour of duty in India from 
1839-47. It returned to England in 1843, and subsequently served in Scotland and Ireland until
the start of the Crimean War in 1853.

The Crimean War - 1853 to 1856
</h3>

<p>
In 1853 Russia declared war on Turkey, and Great Britain and France intervened on the side of the latter.
An Anglo- French force was despatched to the Crimea. It included the 1/21<sup>st</sup> which took part 
in the victory on the Alma and in the battle of Inkerman, where it made an heroic stand on a 
position on the Inkerman Heights known as ‘The Barrier’. 
The 21st served in the trenches before Sevastopol (1854) during the long siege and 
subsequently at its capture.
Peace was declared in 1856 after a war notorious for the privations inflicted on the troops who took part.

The Post Crimean Years - 1856 to 1914
</h3>

<p>
Following the end of the Crimean War in 1856, the 1/21<sup>st</sup> went to Malta where
it stayed 
on Garrison Duties until 1860.
From Malta it was posted to the West Indies where it stayed until its return to England in 1864.
After various postings in Scotland, England and Wales it sailed to India in 1868 where
it stayed until its return to Britain in 1881.
It was while it was in India that,
in 1877, the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion of the 21<sup>st</sup>   was authorised
to use its old title and became the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers&nbsp;
In 1896 it returned to India where it stayed until 1909.
During this period the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion&nbsp; served with the Malakand Field Force during its operations on the 
North-West Frontier of India and it was here that it was awarded the battle honour
TIRAH.
</p>

<p>
The 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers left India in 1909 and was engaged in Garrison Duties in South Africa until 1914 when
it returned to Gosport.

Later in 1919 the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers moved to Bordon, Hampshire.
</p>

<p>
In January 1921 the Battalion s was sent to Ireland for operations in aid of the Civil Power during the Troubles. 
Following the settlement with the Irish leaders the Battalion left Ireland in 1922. 
Entraining at the Curragh to move to Dublin for embarkation, it was the last British unit to leave 
that once-famous camp.
</p>

<p>
For the next 10 years the Battalion served at Edinburgh, Portsmouth and Bordon

The 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers overseas tour of duty began in Palestine in 1932. 
Later that year it was transferred to Egypt where it served for 4 years. 
1936 saw a sudden return to Palestine when trouble between Jews and Arabs escalated into the ‘Arab Revolt’. 
The Battalion was deployed in support of the Civil Power and fought several small actions until the 
Revolt ended in October 1936. 
At the end of that year the Battalion was moved to India. 
It was still there when the Second World War broke out in September 1939

Post War - 1945 to 1959

</h3>

<p>
The 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers returned to India from Burma in 1945. 
The next two years were to be eventful and troubled as India prepared for independence and tensions 
increased between Muslims and Hindus. 
The Battalion was stationed in Delhi with a mixed remit of internal security and ceremonial duties. 
Later it moved to Meerut but soon returned to Delhi. 
Late in 1947 it was heavily involved in evacuating British civilians from the Punjab.
</p>

<p>
In December 1947 the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers, now reduced to a cadre, left India and returned home, being stationed in 
Ayr prior to moving to join the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion in Germany.
The cadre of the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion&nbsp; joined the 2 Battalion in Dortmund and in October1948 the
2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion was re-titled the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers.
</p>

<p>
The Battalion continued to serve in Germany, stationed in Dortmund, Bielefeld, Munster and Wuppertal. 
At the end of 1952 it moved to what was to be its last station of the tour, Berlin.
From here the Regiment received news that it was to prepare for an operational tour in Malaya
</p>

<p>
Leaving Berlin early in 1954 the Battalion disembarked in Singapore at the end of April. 
Following training in Johore it moved north, joining the 1st Federal Division. 
This was the time of the Malayan Emergency and a period of continuous active service, mostly in the jungle. 
</p>

<p>
The 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers left Malaya for Britain in May 1957 where it became part of 1st Guards Brigade. 
In 1958 the Battalion was sent to Cyprus to carry out internal security operations, the Greek Cypriot terror 
campaign having aroused the Turkish Cypriots to strike against the Greeks. 
</p>

<p>
In October 1958, the Battalion returned to Britain where, on the 20<sup>th</sup> January 1959, the 
Royal Scots Fusiliers ceased to exist.
On that date the amalgamation of the Royal Scots Fusiliers and the Highland
Light Infantry took place at Edinburgh to form the Royal Highland Fusiliers .
