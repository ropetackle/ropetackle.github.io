Memorandum<br />
By His Excellency General Viscount Kitchener of Khartoum, G.C.B, O.M.,
G.C.M.G., Commander-in Chief in India
</h3>
        
<p>
On his arrival in India Lord Kitchener learnt with regret the very serious extent of the ravages 
made by venereal disease among British Troops serving in this country and at once set to work to 
combat its growth and spread in the Army.
The results of these efforts, so far, have been encouraging but there is a limit to what can be done 
in this direction by the authorities to whom the welfare of the soldier during his tour of service 
is entrusted, unless they receive the hearty co-operation and assistance of the men themselves, 
and it is in order to obtain their help that Lord Kitchener now addresses to them these remarks 
which he desires them to read and to keep in mind during their service in India.
</p>
        
<p>
Lord Kitchener feels sure that new arrivals in this country, and even those of more experience, 
frequently suffer from want of knowledge of how to protect themselves from the dangers to which 
they are exposed in a strange country, and of the means by which they can best preserve their 
health and render themselves a credit to their corps.
</p>
        
<p>
The climate and conditions of life in India are unfortunately such as to create temptations greater 
than those which exist in countries outside the tropics.
The absence of home associations throws men more on their own resources and deprives them of many of 
those helps towards resisting temptation which surround them in England.
During the cold weather there may perhaps be enough work, healthy exercise and amusement to keep 
them occupied, mentally and physically; but through the long months of great heat in the plains, time
often hangs heavily on their hands and, with want of occupation, comes the temptation to excessive indulgence.
</p>
        
<p>
It is therefore all the more necessary that those who are serving their country in India should exert 
to the utmost those powers of self-restraint with which every man is provided in order that he may 
exercise a proper control over his appetites.
They should avoid any excess in liquor; on no account touch country spirits; take an active interest 
in their profession, and do their utmost towards making themselves really smart and efficient soldiers 
in every respect.
They should take part in all healthy out door sports and games and always keep themselves in good training 
and physically fit.
Both mind and body should be fully occupied and a lively interest cultivated in all their surroundings. 
In this way, work will be found much easier and life generally more pleasant.
</p>
        
<p>
Above all things, men must remember that they should do credit to their regiments, for the good name of a 
regiment lies in the keeping of every man belonging to it and necessarily suffers if the men become 
inefficient through venereal.
It is discreditable, and even dishonest, that by contracting through self-indulgence a disease which he can 
avoid, a man should render himself incapable of doing that work for his country which he enlisted to do.
</p>

<p>
Unless pride in their corps and the desire to do it credit, keeps men from this danger they must be 
prepared to see other regiments chosen for active service when the chance comes and their own left behind.
</p>
        
<p>
It is therefore the duty of a soldier, not only to keep himself clear of disease, but also by his good 
example to help his comrades to avoid temptation.
The older men particularly should realise their responsibilities in this respect.
Very much depends on the tone and example which they set, and even if they themselves have suffered there
is all the more need that they should do their utmost to keep their younger comrades straight and prevent 
them from lowering the good name of the regiment as a whole.
No soldier who is unable to exercise due restraint in these matters can expect to be entrusted with 
command over his comrades.
</p>
        
<p>
Every man can by self-control restrain the indulgence of those imprudent and reckless impulses that so 
often lead men astray, and he who thus resists is a better soldier and a better man than the man of 
weaker will who allows his bodily appetites to rule him and who lacks the strength of character to 
resist temptation and to refuse to follow any bad example he may see before him.
</p>
        
<p>
Remember the better influences of life.
What would your mothers, your sisters and friends at home think of you if they saw you in hospital, 
degraded by this cause?
And later on in life, when you may rightly hope to marry and settled down, it will make a difference to 
your own happiness and that of your family - which no words can express - if you can do so with a body 
clear of those loathsome diseases which, if once contracted, may be passed on to your children.
</p>
        
<p>
The common women as well as the regular prostitutes in India are almost all more or less infected with disease.
It is rife in the country and in the villages as well as in the towns, and it is only by avoiding 
altogether the many facilities for indulgence which India affords that men can be sure of remaining 
safe from infection.
The danger is not merely limited to the venereal diseases, syphilis, gonorrhoea and chancre.
Numbers of cases have occurred in which soldiers have died of plague and small-pox contracted from 
native women.
Such diseases when contracted by Europeans from natives of Asia or Africa are almost invariably fatal, 
for diseases passed on from one race of men to another always increase in severity. 
Similarly, syphilis contracted by Europeans from Asiatic women is much more severe than that 
contracted in England.
It assumes a horrible, loathsome and often fatal form through which in time, as years pass on, the 
sufferer finds his hair falling off, his skin and flesh of his body rot, and are eaten away by slow 
cankerous and stinking ulcerations; his nose first falls in at the bridge and then rots and falls off; 
his sight gradually fails and he eventually becomes blind; his voice first becomes husky and then 
fades to a hoarse whisper as his throat is eaten away by foetid ulcerations which cause his breath to stink.
In the hospitals, and among the suicides, many such exemples [sic] are to be found.
Gonorrhoea, again, although it begins as merely a scalding local inflammation, slowly spreads and 
infects other parts of the body and the blood, giving rise to other disease, such as stricture 
(which causes excruciating pain), bladder troubles, and rheumatism of the joints.
Though these disease do not appear at once, they all follow in time and increase as the sufferer grows older.
</p>
        
<p>
The only hope for those who have the misfortune to contract such diseases, is to submit to the 
<i>earliest possible treatment by a qualified medical officer,</i> for delay is  most dangerous.
Nor can any permanent good result from resorting for aid to Bazaar quacks or patent medicines, for the 
disease will not be eradicated but will break out again and again in the years to come so that the 
sufferer will infect his wife, and their children (if any) will be diseased and weakly cripples.
</p>
        
<p>
Lord Kitchener would further point out that, although the military penalties incurred by those who 
contract venereal diseases can only be considered as of minor importance when compared to the more 
dreadful and far-reaching consequences above referred to, yet men should remember that they exist and 
should know what they are.
Promotion may be affected; first class service pay is forfeited, for it is given for efficiency, 
and men who have suffered from these diseases remain inefficient for long periods; guards and duties missed
while in hospital have to be made good, so that the self-indulgence of those who contract disease may 
not throw extra work on their comrades; on their return to duty they may find all indulgences, passes, etc., 
withheld and the canteen may be closed against them.
Should men be invalided for venereal diseases gratuities and pensions are liable to be affected.
</p>
        
<p>
Further, it must be remembered that it is impossible for long to conceal the existence of
disease, and that the attempt to do so is an offence which is very severely punished.
</p>        

<p>
Lord Kitchener asks all the men who compose the British army in India, which he is proud to command, 
to read this memorandum very carefully and think over these matters; let each then consider for himself 
whether indulgence is worth the pirce [sic] which has to be paid for it in disease, in punishment, in 
injury to the man himself, his wife and his children, in destruction of the efficiency of his corps and in 
degradation of his own body and mind.
