This publication contains the following description of Rickerby:-
</p>

<blockquote>
Rickerby, or <i>Richardby</i>, is a small but pleasant hamlet and township on the banks of the Eden, 
1½ miles east by north from Carlisle. 
It contains only about eighty inhabitants, and 510 acres of land, rated at £1046, nearly all the property 
of Geo. Head Head, Esq. whose seat is <i>Rickerby House</i>, a beautiful mansion in a delightful situation, 
about a mile east of Carlisle. 
The manor was formerly dependant on the barony of Linstock or Crosby; but the land is now all enfranchised. 
It was part of the large possessions of the Tilliols, from whom it passed successively to the Pickerings, 
Westons, Musgraves, Studholmes, Gilpins, Richardsons, &amp;c. 
Here is a very neat school, erected in 1835, by G.H. Head, Esq. who nearly supports it at his own expense, 
and supplies the school necessaries. 
There are about sixty children, on an average, in attendance, and the school seems to be well and ably 
conducted by Mr. Francis P. Blundell, the present master.
