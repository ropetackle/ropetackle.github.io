This publication contains the following description of Rickerby:-
</p>


<blockquote>
RICKERBY is a small township comprising 560 statute acres belonging to Miles MacInnes, Esq., and the 
Carlisle Corporation. Its rateable value is £1,439.

<p>
The Manor of Rickerby or Richardby was formerly a dependant on the barony of Linstock or Crosby, but the 
land is now all enfranchised. 
It was part of the large possessions of the Tilliols, from whom it passed successively to the
Pickerings, Westons, Musgraves, Stud- holmes, Gilpins, Richardsons and Grahams.
</p>

<p>
Rickerby House, the residence of Miles MacInnes, Esq., J.P., is a beautiful mansion occupying a 
delightful situation, about a mile east of Carlisle. 
The present proprietor succeeded to the estate of the late G. Head Head, Esq., in 1876.
</p>

<p>
The village of Rickerby is pleasantly located about one and a half miles E. by N. of Carlisle. 
There is a small school here, erected in 1835 by the late G. Head Head, Esq., and now almost entirely 
supported by Miles MacInnes, Esq.
