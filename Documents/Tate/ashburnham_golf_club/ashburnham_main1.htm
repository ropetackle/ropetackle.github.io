The present testing links of Ashburnham, where only the brave and deadly accurate can hope to be under par, 
owes much to the designer tastes of the redoubtable John Henry Taylor whose standing in the roll call 
of the British greats of the Royal and Ancient game is undiminished today, 81 years after he had won 
his fifth Open championship.        
<p>
J H Taylor joined Harry Vardon and James Braid to form the Great Triumvirate of British golf in the early 
years, emerging as the game’s first superstars. 
All three played at Ashburnham – and all three were impressed with what the course had to offer as a supreme 
test of their special skills.
</p>

<p>
In 1904 Vardon was to announce, after playing here for the first time: “The course I like best in Wales is 
Ashburnham. 
It is one of those excellent links which require very little attention.”
</p>

<p>
Six years later Taylor came to Wales, negotiated Ashburnham’s new 18-hole lay-out in a record score and 
offered some advice on how the 5,841 yards of seaside terrain which resident professional William Tate 
<i>[should be David Tate. – RM]</i> had first laid out in 1902 could be improved.
</p>

<p>
“The turf and ‘going’ throughout are excellent,” he wrote to expectant officials who had waited 
patiently for weeks for the great man’s verdict on their course. 
Taylor continued: “The greens, collectively speaking, are spacious, true, well kept and their 
positions are well placed. 
When the alterations and suggestions are carried out and the bunkers I indicated made, I am confident that 
Ashburnham Golf Club will have a links that will challenge comparison with many of the best seaside 
courses in the country.”........
</p>

<p>
….....The game was now firmly established, the club had already become a thriving focal point for many of 
the industrialists and professionals of the Llanelly area and confidence in the future was growing, 
so much so that in November 1897, moves were set in motion to appoint a first professional. 
The agreement with Mr Pittock <i>[the greenkeeper - RM] </i>was not renewed and within three weeks of 
launching the search for a suitable replacement and pro, 27 applications came flooding in. 
These were whittled down to a shortlist of seven, from whom

target="_top" title="David Tate's Entry">
 David Tate</a>, of the Fulnech Club, Leeds, 
was appointed as professional and greenkeeper on the same terms as William Hoare had been engaged 
three-and-a-half years earlier – a princely 18s per week. 
The new man’s job description was blunt and to the point. 
His principal task would be “to keep the greens and tees in order and repair clubs”. 
Obviously the bait which attracted David Tate from Yorkshire to Carmarthenshire was the concession that 
he be allowed to charge 1s instruction fee for every nine holes played with a member.
</p>

<p>
He took up his duties on New Year’s Day 1898, and within a few weeks had squeezed another concession 
out of the watchful Council members. 
A meeting on January 27 “resolved that the professional remain in his shed on Saturday afternoons. 
Also that he be provided with a lamp in his workshop and oil for the same, and that he be paid the amount 
he had expended on the oil stove.” 
Things were looking up for Mr. Tate – and there was even better to come. 
On March 26 the Council agreed that “the professional’s wages be increased from 18s to 20s.” 
A pay rise of around 11 per cent was indeed a handsome reward – but he did have some extra duties to perform. 
Later in the year he was called up to fence off five of the nine greens which were coming under increasing 
threat from inquisitive cattle and horses
</p>

<p>
In the same year, the club reached another momentous decision – that a ball-making machine be purchased. 
What such a device looked like is a matter for much conjecture, viewed from a 1994 perspective. 
But it must have been a fairly expensive addition to facilities because it was ruled that the payment for 
what was obviously a breakthrough in the sporting technology of the late 19<sup>th</sup> century would be 
made on the never-never. 
In August, 1899, it was agreed that the professional should have the use of the machine free of charge.
</p>

<p>
The dawn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century found the club in good heart. 
It was the beginning of a period of rapid and significant change in the process of establishing the 
Pembrey links as one of the best in Wales. 
Expansion to match ambition was very much in the air……to be able to compete with the best they needed to 
play regularly over an 18-hole course….planning to extend the course and raise the capital to do so was 
set in motion.
</p>

<p>
By March, 1902, the Earl Ashburnham had signified his agreement for the extra land from his estate to be 
used and generously offered to contribute £20 towards the cost of constructing the extra holes and help 
meet the other costs by upping his annual donation to £10. 
Estimates were that it would take £100 to lay out the new holes and cost an additional £70 a year to 
maintain them. 
The Earl’s terms gave the club access to the extra acreage at a nominal yearly rent of 10 shillings.
</p>

<p>
To help with the extra costs, subscriptions were raised by a guinea, while it was also decided that 
donations be invited from members. 
This eventually brought in the not inconsiderable sum of £148 16s. 
David Tate was instructed to get down to the task of laying out an 18-hole course immediately and again
work was swift. 
To ensure it was, the professional was allowed to recruit an assistant, and  on April 25, 1902, 
the assistant, an F Selwood, joined the staff to earn £1 a week. 
There is no surviving record of Tate’s wages having been advanced in the meantime but it is safe to 
assume that they had been. 
It is hardly likely that he would have agreed to continue under the earlier terms which would have 
meant his assistant earning as much as he did.
</p>

<p>
Messrs. Tate and Selwood obviously worked expeditiously and well. 
On June 20 it was reported: “The additional nine holes were inspected and found satisfactory.
Resolved to open it next week, postponing the official opening to when the 5<sup>th</sup> Earl would be 
able to attend.” 
A feeling of euphoria obviously abounded because it was also decided to lay on a celebratory tea for the 
caddies the following month. 
The faithful caddies, drawn almost exclusively from the eager young of Pembrey, had established themselves 
as a vital part of the operation. 
The best were in constant demand, so much so that it was also decided in June, 1902, “to appoint a 
professional caddie-master on Saturdays, match days and Bank Holidays, and that an additional penny be 
added for him to the tariff – 10d for 18 holes and 7d for nine holes”….
</p>

<p>
The extended course was used for the first time on June 27, and a month later the first 18-hole match 
was played…. 
The new lay-out was obviously to the liking of the officials who immediately voted to hand the 
industrious David Tate a £5 bonus for his efforts. 
He and his assistant later joined the caddies for a “Coronation Tea” in the Ashburnham Hotel. 
That was obviously a success, as it was recorded at the time: “It was followed by sports which were 
much enjoyed by the boys”….
</p>

<p>
Early in 1903 David Tate announced he was leaving to take up a similar appointment with the Radyr club 
in Cardiff. 
His departure must have been viewed with some alarm because the Council voted to tempt him to remain by 
offering a wage increase of 5s per week. 
That was a considerable inducement, but was not enough. 
Tate, the man who planned the 18-hole course which is not far removed from the one enjoyed by members 
nearly a century later, is a name which figures prominently in Ashburnham history – but on February
18, 1903, he was gone, after a stay of just over five years. 
But that was not the last members heard of him.
</p>

<p>
He was replaced by William Coombes who was tempted to move from Coventry by the promise of a weekly 
wage in return for being something of a jack-of-all-trades in West Wales. 
Coombes remained in the post until leaving in January, 1908. 
The club advertised immediately to fill the vacancy, and among the applications was one from David Tate. 
It seemed to arouse considerable enthusiasm among Council members who, after exploring the credentials of
two other hopefuls, had no hesitation in offering Tate the chance to take up the post he had vacated 
five years earlier when not even the bait of a fairly substantial increase in his remuneration could 
keep him at Ashburnham. 
The second time round he was clearly more receptive to extra cash from his employers, at least that is 
what disgruntled local members must have thought when he withdrew his application – after being 
offered the Ashburnham job.
</p>

<p>
In his place, W.H. Finch, from Hornsea, was appointed the new professional.
