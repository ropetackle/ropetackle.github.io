<p>
Dear Mrs. Kingdon
</p>

<p>
I thank you for your letter and note you have kept two photos and I am very pleased you have taken these.
</p>

<p>
Yes I have kept the correspondence going with Jack &amp; Elsie.
Elsie writes a good letter and we had a good holiday there some few years ago. 
Yes I am still getting over the shock of Dora’s death although it happened nearly 10 months ago. 
I am now living with my cousin at the above address. 
This is our house and is where I was born.
</p>

<p>
I was along seeing Uncle Bob and Aunty and their family this week. 
They are keeping much the same and have good days and bad days.
One of their family, your cousin Edith (now Mrs. F Thwaites) is not too grand. 
She has had an operation and is now having deepfreeze treatment.
I conveyed your deepest love &amp; regards to them and also of Florrie &amp; Dolly. 
Yes there were photos of previous generations but these seem to have all gone. 
However I have got a memorandum of the sale of Rickerby Estate and a newspaper cutting which I think 
you would like to see. 
I am sending you these, but please let me have them back when you have read them all. 
There is no immediate hurry.
</p>

<p>
Dora has often told me about the history of your grandparents and this is what she said.
</p>

<p>
Your Grandfather’s

title="Mrs Tate's Entry">
 mother</a> lived at 

<a href="../../../maps/tate_maps/longtown/longtown_main.htm" target="main"
title="Map Showing Longtown">
Longtown</a>, a village about 9 miles from here near the Scottish Border. 
She went to be a maid at 

<a href="../../../maps/tate_maps/evening_hill/evening_hill_main.htm"
target="main" title="Map Showing Evening Hill">
 Evening Hill</a>, a mansion about 5 miles from Carlisle, with the Robinson’s. 
This family had a 

<a href="../../../Tate/tate_1st_mr_robinson/tate_1st_mr_robinson_frame.htm"
title="Mr Robinson's Entry">
son</a>, who was sweet about the maid, and she had to have a child through him. 
His father, Mr. Robinson senior, made the son marry your Great Grandmother. 
They were married at 

<a href="../../../maps/tate_maps/longtown/longtown_main.htm" target="main"
title="Map Showing Arthuret Church">
 Athuret church</a> and their names are in the Register. 
When he came out of the church young Mr. Robinson who had been married ran away and went to South Africa. 
Your Great Grandmother was disgusted and changed her name back to Tate, and brought your

<a href="../../../Tate/tate_2nd_george_tate/tate_2nd_george_tate_frame.htm"
title="George Tate's Entry">
 Grandfather</a> up 
as a Tate. 
He was a canny old gentleman and money did not worry him. 
He did not claim the Robinson’s money and when his father died the money went into Chancery as there was
no one the name of Robinson to claim it. 
Dora’s Dad, your Uncle 

<a href="../../../Tate/tate_3rd_edward_tate/tate_3rd_edward_tate_frame.htm"
title="Edward Tate's Entry">
Edward</a>, gave a cousin of yours Thomas Tate some money for him to go and see if he 
could claim anything. 
However it fell through because there was no birth certificate of your Grandfather. 
So you see Mrs. Kingdon there is a lot of money which the Tates cannot get hold of, but I think they all 
think they have had happy lives without it.
</p>

<p>
I remember your 

<a href="../../../Tate/tate_3rd_david_tate/tate_3rd_david_tate_frame.htm"
title="David Tate's Entry">
 Dad</a> coming to Rickerby. He did not like Rickerby, when he had to Bow etc to the Macinnes 
and went off to America.
</p>

<p>
In our village there are 9 houses and 3 farms. Dora’s Dad had 5 cottages and when he died Dora got them. 
She got electric light in them all, then about 22 years ago she got water into every house and 
Water Closets, and we got a bathroom in our house. 
They were as you know old houses and needed a lot of repair and about 10 years ago Dora gave them 
practically away to the sitting tenants. 
They are all (?) houses now and 3 have bath rooms and W.C’s inside and out
</p>

<p>
I am going to (?) your letter and give it to Aunty &amp; Bob &amp; their family.
</p>

<p>
Rather glad to say I am keeping much the same, although I got a shock about a fortnight ago, when my 
sister’s husband died at his desk at the office.
</p>

<p>
(?) I think this is all and I do trust it finds you fairly well
</p>

<p>
Yours Sincerely<br />
Jack Coulthard
