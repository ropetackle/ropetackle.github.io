Madam,

<p>
You are requested to take the attached Army Form B.155 on the morning of the 17th instant without 
fail to the Medical Officer, Recruiting Office, Nottingham, for completion as to your fitness
to embark for South Africa. You should show him this letter.
</p>
      
<p>
If it is not practicable on account of distance to attend for Examination by this Medical Officer, 
then you may have the certificate completed by a civilian Practitioner, but any expense for fees must be
defrayed by you.
</p>
      

<p>
You must attend on the day stated viz 17th instant.
</p>
      
<p>
The Army Form B.155, when completed, is to be taken by you to Southampton with the other 
Embarkation Returns and handed in there. 
Please be careful of the Form, as without it you may not be allowed to embark.
</p>
      
<p>
If the Medical Officer states that you are unfit to embark, you must not proceed to Southampton, 
but forward his certificate to me.
</p>

Yours faithfully,<br />
