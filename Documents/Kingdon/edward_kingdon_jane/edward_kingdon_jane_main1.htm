May 3rd 1981
</h4>

<p>
Set off at 6.10am from Bourton, a very hard frost, grieved for my geraniums which 
I had rashly planted out yesterday. Via Coventry, M69, M1 to Leeds. 
Very little traffic, mainly dry, cold and windy. 
Took 4 hrs. including 2 stops, very pleasing for a 74 yr. old but felt tired and 
glad to arrive safely.

 Ian</a> there to greet us. 
Very nice feeling ‘to be in the warmth of their bosoms’.
</p>

<p>
All looked well except that Jane was feeling the effects of the previous night, 
not getting to bed until after 3am. 
Andy was in London with Pete and I assume having a similar strenuous evening. 
Heard all the news about the wedding prep. and Ian put on his new suit, shoes etc 
looking quite an aristocratic young man. He is maturing rapidly now.

Peggy</a> joined us at dinner. 
She did not seem so well as at Christmas, small appetite, but the rest of us 
did justice to Helen’s excellent dinner, clean plates, no waste.

<p>
Jane’s rehearsal morning trying on her wedding gown with Nicola in her 
bridesmaid’s dress assisting and Helen supervising. 
Jane looked lovely, very young and pretty in the lovely white dress and veil, a perfect fit.
Helen put on her new outfit for the wedding and Mum and I thought how attractive she looked. 
She keeps remarkably young looking.

 Laba</a> and I too put on our wedding apparel. 
Laba’s floral dress, black velvet jacket and pink hat last worn for Sheila’s wedding 
looked very good and I do not think we will disgrace our children, although I am 
having difficulty in getting the paint stains out of my boiler suit.
</p>

<p>
Andy arrived later from London, liked the table I had made for them.
</p>

<p>
Jane and Andy had been to Leeds. 
In the evening heard much of how everybody was getting involved in the wedding, expecting 52 guests. 
Cards and presents arriving. Gave them our gift of £500.
</p>

<p>
Gave Helen and Robin £500 towards wedding expenses. A sunny day, able to sit outside the Lister’s.
</p>

<p>
Went up to the Golf Course with Ian, second day in succession. Thoroughly enjoyed it. 
If he sticks at it should become a good golfer. 49 yesterday, 45 today, good for a beginner.
</p>

<h4 class=main>
May 7th
</h4>

<p>
Joined by Andy and Jane at the Lister’s. We liked him very much and enjoyed his company. 
Talked about their plans for the future and we were pleased to hear that when he 
has become more established and also a few years older they hope to start a 
family – great grandparents – lovely.
</p>

<p>
Just Laba and I and Susie 8pm in the house. 
Helen teaching, the rest down at the Parish Church rehearsing for Sat. 
Robin giving the bride, Andy receiving, Pete best manning, Nicola bridesmaiding, 
Ian ushering and the Vicar presiding.
</p>

<p>
Wedding eve, sunny day, Jane and Andy more relaxed, looking forward to tomorrow, 
all preparations completed. 
Evening spent at the Troutbeck and Craiglands with our Joy and Albert, Andy’s family. 
Jane with us but Andy with the lads.
</p>

<p>
Wedding day. Dull, threatening rain.
</p>

<p>
6.30am Robin with tea. Felt excited.
</p>

<p>
By 9.30am all of us in wedding clothes, Jane looking particularly lovely. 
Nicola and Sue, Jane’s bridesmaids had arrived and a real festive atmosphere developing. 
It was a stroke of genius on Helen’s part to invite the neighbours to view the 
bride and toast her before the ceremony. 
Joined by Joy and Albert who took Mum and me to the Church for the 11 o’clock service. 
About 70 – 80 people in the Church, a thrill for us when Jane walked down the aisle 
on the arm of her dad. 
We found the Church service very moving and Jane and Andy looked so much in harmony 
that to me the service had a depth and meaning which I shall always remember.
</p>

<p>
From where we sat I could not see Jane’s face but Andy was in profile and his 
loving, caring expression as he looked at Jane made a deep impression. 
The Vicar is to be congratulated for helping to make it such a moving occasion.
</p>

<p>
When the service was over photos were taken outside the Church, not only by the 
professional photographer but also by numerous amateurs of whom Ian was one. 
There was no wind, no rain but no sun.
</p>

<p>
Albert drove Joy, Laba and me to the reception at the Troutbeck where the bride 
and groom and their parents greeted the guests, sherry provided and a happy atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
About 2pm, dined in a lovely room, making a delightful setting for bride, groom and guests. 
A very colourful scene with the tables beautifully layed.
</p>

<p>
The bride and groom were the last to appear and were greeted by thunderous 
clapping as they made their way to the top table. 
Again I was moved and dropped a tear in my wine glass.
</p>

<p>
Now the eats. 
Prawn Cocktail for starters and Joy who was sitting next to me said “There are 
prawn cocktails and prawn cocktails, this is delicious” and Joy knows as she loves her belly.
</p>

<p>
Then beef, ham, chicken, pork pie, variety of salads, creams and sauces, 
all freshly prepared and served with red and white wine.
</p>

<p>
Then sherry trifle and or fruit followed by coffee and nobody enjoyed it more 
than Mum and me.
</p>

<p>
Jane and Andy looked a lovely couple, cutting the cake another tear dropped in 
my wine and then the toasts.
</p>

<p>
There were three speakers – Robin, Andy and Pete the best man and I don’t think 
I have ever heard three consecutive speeches which harmonised so much, setting 
just the right note and expressing that deep feeling on such a joyful occasion.
</p>

<p>
Robin, the first speaker excelled himself, an excellent speech as was Andy’s and Pete.
</p>

<p>
Then an enjoyable hour in the lounge bar, during which time the lads completely 
obliterated the going away car with signs and symbols, stuck on with shaving cream.
</p>

<p>
And then for me a moving farewell, Jane embracing me with deep feeling, the 
tears streaming down her face. 
Into the car with Andy and off to Leeds Airport for their honeymoon in Amsterdam.
</p>

<p>
Then back to the house for tea and chat, the two families, Joy and Albert and Sheila and George. 
I think Helen deserves the thanks of all us for making it such a harmonious occasion. 
She was the Queen Pin.
