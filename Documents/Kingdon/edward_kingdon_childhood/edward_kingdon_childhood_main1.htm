His First Job
</h3>
</a>

<h4 class=main>
Dec 24th 1978
</h4>

<p>
When I was 8 years old, the war had broken out, I got my first job, 
also at 1d <i>[½p.]</i> a day but my day was only 1 hour 6-7am.
</p>
 
<p>
Earlier in the year I had broken my arm falling out of a tree, 
the arm had been set badly and I was having difficulty in bending it 
and touching my shoulder with the tips of my fingers. 
The cure was to swing a bag of sand, very boring.   
Swinging milk churns much more exciting.
</p>
  
<p>
I loved the job. 
It involved going with the milkman on his round and I did the big houses, 
the ones with long drives and a couple of manor houses, 
one of which belonged to Colonel ? I’ve forgotten his name.
</p>
  
<p>
There were no milk bottles, the gentry’s milk being carried in small churns with handles. 
There were gallon churns, half gallon and quart. 
<i>[A gallon was 8 pints or 4.54 litres, a quart 2 pints or 1.14 litres.]</i>. 
They were filled in the dairy before we set off, each customer having his own churn. 
These small churns were arranged around the sides of the cart, 
on self made shelves very much like the shelves in a larder but with a 
wooden guarding rail to prevent them falling off.
</p>

<p>
In the well of the cart, I believe it was an adapted large trap, 
stood the two large churns, one containing the fresh milk and the other the skimmed. 
The skimmed was I believe ¼ d (one farthing) a pint or it might have been a quart.
</p>

</h4>

<p>
The reins passed from the horse between the churns and we milkmen stood 
on a platform at the back of the trap holding the reins.
</p>

<p>
I liked doing this and it was quite safe for an eight year old to drive 
as the old horse knew better than I did when to stop and start.
</p>

<p>
When the churns were in position, a wooden bench with two holes in 
was placed over the churns and rested about 1/3 the way down. 
This secured the churns and there was no danger of them moving about as we bumped over the rough roads.
</p>

<p>
The wooden bench with the two holes reminded me of the familiar   lavatory seat at the bottom of the garden. 
Most people only had a one hole seat, but some did have a larger lav. with a two hole seat.
</p>

<p>
A bucket was under the hole to receive the contributions of people 
‘in extremis’ – and in my case you had to be ‘in extremis’ to pay a 
visit especially when the bucket was full. 
I never had the pleasure of occupying one seat with a companion using the other. 
I doubt whether a double seat was meant for that. 
It was probably a reserve bucket for occasions when there was an excessive flow of contributions.
</p>

<p>
However back to intake rather than output. 
The milk was still warm from the cow and it was my job to run up the 
long drives carrying the correct churn which I deposited at the back door 
if the empty churn was outside, if not I knocked and it was usually a servant who answered.
</p>

<p>
She handed me the previous days churn, always scoured clean and 
they were also done again when we got back to the dairy. Each churn had a tight fitting lid.
</p>

<p>
The metal lid fitted snugly into the inside neck of the churn with 
an overlapping flange which fitted equally snugly to the exterior neck of the churn.
Conditions were as ideal as it was possible to make them at that time 
for the clean delivery of milk.
</p>

<p>
Cows milked outside dairy, buckets emptied into churns in dairy, 
churns sealed and milk delivered untouched by hand.
</p>

<p>
It was different with the large churns as the lids had to be left off, 
allowing the milk man to ladle out the pints and half pints in the jugs of the customers. 
The roads, not macadamed but steam rollered stones could be very dusty in 
summer and horse traffic added to the number of flies.
</p>

<p>
The perks were nearly all in kind – a piece of cake or tart, an apple, 
an occasional boiled sweet or stick of liquorice.
</p>

<p>
This delightful job ended after twelve months because of a visit 
to our house of the prospective parliamentary candidate for the Totnes division. 
We often put up visiting Labour speakers for the night and this particular 
one was a Miss Kate Spurrell an ardent member of the Independent Labour Party. 
This interfering busy body persuaded my

 father</a> that I was being exploited 
by the Capitalist Society and in spite of my tears the Capitalist Society 
immediately lost an exploitee and I did not commercially work again until I started teaching.

The line is alas no more and Helston has no railway station. 
Our journey cost us nothing as my father was allowed 2 free passes a year for himself and family. 
He never used his until the twenties because there were no paid holidays.

Nov 28th 1980

<p>
Saw television play in which an old fashioned slate was being used. 
Revived very vivid memories of infants’ school days at Decoy, Newton Abbot. 
Slates and slate pencils were the basic materials for the teaching of writing. 
I can feel the squeaks of the pencils now. 
The slates were of 3 different kinds, those with the letters of the alphabet and 
lined, those with sentences e.g. “Waste not, want not” and plain ones. 
We graduated from the first to the third according to our proficiency. 
The writing was copper plate, thin up strokes and thick down strokes. 
A natural left-hander I have no recollection of being forced to write right handed. 
I suspect I was skilfully encouraged for which I salute Miss Hockaday and Miss Warcham. 
I can remember changing hands when my right got tired but I never mastered the “copper plate”. 
I know this because the best pupils had a brand new slate occasionally – 
a lovely black virgin surface – but my slates were always dirty grey and a light grey at that. 
It grieved me. 
Morning school started with a hands and head inspection – cleanliness – and then we 
had to show our rags which for most of us served a double purpose – slate and nose wiper. 
The rag had to be slightly damp. 
As it dried out it was topped up with spit. 
The slate was used for English, Arithmetic and Drawing – the latter a prized lesson 
on Friday afternoons when coloured chalks were issued. 
It seems so vivid I’m inhaling the chalk dust now.

<p>
I stayed to go to one of my favourite haunts Dr Riley’s Book Shop in Skipton Rd. 
nobody there i.e. no customers so sat talking to a youngish looking grandmother 
who was minding the shop. 
Bought two books, one by Silas Hocking published in the 90’s. 
Have read the first chapter, an echo of the later stories in <i> The Magnet</i> of which I was 
an avid reader.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Magnet</i>, <i>Gem</i>, <i> Penny Popular</i> were the main children’s weekly publications, 
full scale stories, not comics. 
The <i> Magnet</i> was delivered to our house every week from about 1913 – 20 and all copies 
were carefully kept in the cupboard under the stairs. 
The boys of Greyfriars School opened up a new world to me, my hero being Bob Cherry, 
closely followed by Harry Wharton. 
To me Billy Bunter was quite a minor character.

<p>
3 pm. By the fireside waiting for the milkman.
</p>

<p>
Marjorie remembers the name of our first milkman in Chadwell Heath 1930 - ? 
The small dairies had not yet disappeared and Mr Flowers was a worthy representative – 
an authority on the Gulf Stream. 
Whatever the weather the Gulf Stream came into it. His shop was in Mill Lane, a dairy cum grocer’s. 
Mrs Margam, a colleague at Green Lane School, was the wife of a dairyman. 
Their shop was in the City of Westminster which they had taken on in the late twenties, 
their business in Maesteg, S Wales having failed due to the miners’ strike and the 
continuing unemployment.
</p>

<p>
Horses still drew the carts, milk, bread and coal and as far as I can recollect 
I was still rushing out with bucket and shovel until at least 1945 to collect their manurial droppings.
</p>

<p>
Horse troughs, water carts and steam rollers, the three go together in my memories of childhood. 
All towns and villages had horse troughs, usually placed in a wide part of the 
thoroughfare, preferably in the square if there was one. 
The one at Decoy was the centre of our favourite playground. 
It was filled with water from the water cart, one of its three duties. 
Its 2nd duty was to wet the stones and road, the steam roller following. 
The 3rd duty was to ‘Lay the dust’ in summer, the roads being only crushed stone 
and very dusty indeed especially if the summer was exceptionally hot and dry.
</p>

<p>
I’d like to come across a picture of Shire Horses drinking from one of those troughs.
</p>

<p>
Vivid childhood memory – 1910 or 11 – two shire horses attached to a brewers’ 
dray, drinking from the trough and the water sinking rapidly, then the urination. 
I had never seen such a cataract. I ran home to tell my Mum. 
She said it was neither nice to watch or to talk about such things.

Tickling Trout

April 17th 1981

<p>Went trout feeding with Stanley. Have not seen so many trout since a boy.
</p>

<p>“Tickled” trout in the trout streams as a small boy but cannot remember ever “tickling” one. 
Tickling meant lying flat on your belly on the small bridge across the stream, 
place your hand in the water palm upwards, wait for a trout to cover the palm, 
jerk the arm upwards and hope to flick the astonished trout on the bank.
