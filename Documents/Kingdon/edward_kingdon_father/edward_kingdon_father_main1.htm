<p>
In November I bought the <i> Pilgrim’s Progress</i> in a ‘junk’ shop in Cheltenham.
</p>

<p>
I bought it mainly because on the inside of the cover was pasted a gift token
of the Primitive Methodist Church inscribed “Presented to Mr. [?] for regular
Attendance July 1910”. To me it was a bit of social history connected with my
early childhood and my 

<a

 father</a>’s life as a young man.
</p>

<p>
In my father’s words “I left school well before I was ten”.
As his birthday was in August it is safe to assume that he left at Easter 1882, 
the start of the busy season on the farm.
</p>

<p>
His first wage was one penny (1/2p) a day, sixpence (2 1/2p) a week 
“for working from dawn to dusk” again his words.
</p>

<p>
Saturday was a short ? day as they finished at tea time and were paid their wages.
</p>

<p>
The following tale I heard many times, the last not long before he died,
and as he got older it was the distress of his mother which weighed with him most heavily.
</p>

<p>
“I was paid with the other labourers at about 4 o’clock.
I had been looking forward all the week to it and was feeling proud to be able
to take a whole sixpence home to my mother – much needed money in a poor household.
</p>

<p>
On being paid, some of the labourers went to the village pub and persuaded me
to come in with them. They bought me a drink and before I really knew what was
happening my sixpence was gone. I had only the one drink – a pint of ale.
</p>

<p>
I left for home crying. My mother did not need telling what had happened
and cried herself bitterly, even more so when my stepfather gave me the biggest
‘leathering’ I ever had in my life”.
</p>

<p>
He always ended with the words “I’ve never forgotten it”.
</p>

<p>
Leathering, thrashing (I wonder if derived from threshing),
walloping seems to be the main words used by the men of that time to describe
domestic corporal punishment; beating, caning, flogging seemed to be more judicial
and in the case of beating upper class.
</p>

I started by reference to the Primitive Methodist Church.
Leaving school at 9 my father’s education was obviously limited and chances
of getting any further education whilst working as a farm labourer in a remote
rural community were also obviously limited.

Bill</a>.
Bill being exactly the same age as myself and of course my uncle –
a fact which caused me some wonder when I was a child.
</p>

<p>
My father was always called by his mother’s name and I imagine he felt very much the odd man out.
Being the eldest and children coming rapidly one after the other and poverty
always with them, an early start to work was a necessity.
</p>

<p>
He never referred to his school days or Sunday School or his step brothers
and sisters as children or even any tales about work on the farm.
Odd remarks about crow scaring, milking cows, shifting muck, thinning and weeding
turnips – back breaking, winter gathering in of turnips to feed cattle –
fingers agonisingly cold. Never of ploughing or sowing or dealing with horses.
I assume he had all the monotonous unpleasant jobs, the start of learning to
become a skilled farm labourer.
</p>

<p>
He used to mention how tired and weary he used to be but no mention of doctors
or illness or social life and certainly there would be no books as there were none
in our house until later years and then very few.
</p>

<p>
At sixteen he went to Exeter to join the Great Western Railway as a cleaner.
And that is all I know – why he went, where he lived, what he felt like,
did he break with home? How long he was at Exeter I don’t know.
</p>

<p>
He must have been able to pass a test in reading, writing and arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
A cleaner was the lowest grade of footplate men – the men who manned the engines.
</p>

<p>
The cleaner’s basic job was to clean the engines but it was really in those days
a long apprenticeship in the understanding of the steam locomotive,
the basic principles and an ability to service it and make running repairs when a driver.
</p>

<p>
I always thought up to the age of 16 ? that he just stood in the cab and drove the engine.
</p>

<p>
In 1922 ? he took me to the Wembley Exhibition, my first visit to London
and at that Exhibition or it might have been the Science Museum there was a locomotive on show.
He started to explain to me the principles of steam locomotion and before
we realised what was happening a crowd had gathered around us.
At first I was very embarrassed but my father was stimulated by the evident
interest of the crowd and continued to talk for a very long time, during which
the crowd got bigger and bigger and I lost my embarrassment and was old enough 
to realise for the first time that he not only drove an engine but he had a real 
understanding of the basic principles of steam engineering, 
hence the reason why he was a member of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers 
and Firemen and not a member of the National Union of Railwaymen.
</p>

<p>
The ‘Associated’ as he called it, now called ASLEF, was a Craft Union 
and although he did not want me to become a workman he was fiercely proud of his 
union and equally contemptuous of the NUR especially of their leader ‘Jimmy Thomas’.
</p>

<p>
I read that the Associated are still causing trouble even though the days of steam have passed. 
It is partly due to their reluctance to renounce their craft union status.

Length of stay at Exeter unknown but was moved to Helston – date unknown. 
Went to lodge at my

 father</a> and now were taking in lodgers.
</p>

<p>
My Aunt Janie’s (Olive’s mother) description of him “Shy, retiring, blushed 
easily and wouldn’t say boo to a goose”.
</p>

<p>
My 

<a
href="../../../Smith/smith_2nd_elizabeth_smith/smith_2nd_elizabeth_smith_frame.htm"
target="_top" title="Elizabeth Smith's Entry">
 grandmother</a>’s description of him “a foreigner”. 
To her anyone born east of the River Tamar was a foreigner, in fact in her case 
she was so much a Cornishwoman that anyone born east of Falmouth and west of the 
Tamar was not really a true Cornishman.
</p>

<p>
Of his time spent in Helston I cannot remember him saying anything except 
occasionally imitating the Cornish lilt of a question that he was probably often 
asked “Going down town arree?”. 
When they were married or where I do not know – either Helston of Plymouth.
</p>

<p>
From Helston he was moved to Plymouth and it was in the district of 
<a class="doc" href="../../../Places%20&%20Buildings/holdsworth_street/holdsworth_street_main.htm"
title="Photo Of Their House In Pennycomequick">
Pennycumquick or Pennycomequick</a> 
 that I was born on 22nd Sept. 1906.
</p>

<p>
According to my mother his wages were 15/- one week (75p) 
and eighteen shillings (90p) the following week if a full week was worked. 
As there was no guaranteed week, at times it could be less. 
I take it that every second week he worked on a Sunday, hence the extra 3/- (15p).
</p>

<p>
And now we come to the Primitive Methodist Church.
</p>

<p>
The Revivalists Moody and Sankey had come to Plymouth – they had Wesley fervour 
and Salvation Army gusto belting out such hymns as <i> ‘Shall we gather at the River, 
the beeootiful, beeootiful River’</i> and <i> ‘Count your blessings name them one by one’</i>.
</p>

<p>
I can dimly remember going to a Revivalist meeting at Exeter when I was about five.
</p>

<p>
We had a Moody and Sankey hymn book in our house and it was still there when my mother died in 1929.
</p>

<p>
My father went to one of their meetings and was converted. That is the only fact I know about it.
</p>

<p>
Converted he now joined a church and that church was the Primitive Methodists, 
strict and narrow in their views, exceeded only by the Plymouth Brethren.
</p>

<p>
Like the other Non Conformist Churches meetings were held on Sunday afternoons 
for young men and women – Bible Classes. 
I believe the Congregationalists called theirs Pleasant Sunday Afternoon.
</p>

<p>
The emphasis by the Non Conformists was on do it yourself and you had to be 
the action giver, not the passive recipient. I am paraphrasing my father’s words now.
</p>

<p>
Shy and diffident he not only had to read aloud in front of others but also 
join in discussions on the subject matter read. The reading was entirely confined to the Bible. 
He was also taught the discipline of reading as it was regarded as compulsory 
to read one chapter of the Bible every day.
</p>

<p>
I don’t know whether it applied to other Bible Classes but in this particular 
one the leader encouraged him to make a précis of what he had read.
</p>

<p>
There were also meetings in the week, Prayer Meetings where you had to get up 
and pray aloud but only if the spirit moved, Band of Hope Meetings (Temperance), 
singing evenings when he discovered that he had quite a good tenor voice and he 
learned a bit about harmony and singing with baritones, basses etc. He enjoyed it. 
I’ve just remembered another smashing hymn “<i>When the roll is called up yonder 
I’ll be there</i>”.
You heathens who read this will have no idea how rousing this sounded
when trebles, tenors, baritones and basses were in full blast. It went like this:-
</p>

<blockquote>
Trebles <i>"When the roll"</i><br />

T B &amp; B <i>"When the roll"</i><br />

All &amp; congregation <i>"When the roll is called up yonder I’ll be there"</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>
I wonder.
</p>

<p>
A single statement of his strangely sticks in my memory. 
“A doctor told me always to read the leading article of a newspaper”.
</p>

<p>
In 1907 he was moved to Princetown, a promotion for him as he was now a 
Fireman-Cleaner and was given a railway house on the edge of Dartmoor.
</p>

<p>
A little 
<a class=doc href="../../../Places%20&%20Buildings/station_cottages/station_cottages_main.htm"
title="Photo Of The Cottages In Princetown">
terrace of cottages</a>, isolated from the village of Princetown. 
Figgins the Station Master lived in one, Newsome the Driver, Kingdon the Fireman, 
French the Ganger and ? the Guard lived in the others.
</p>

<p>
There is a sequel to this.
When Marjorie and I left Exmouth in 1966 we had our one and only ‘posh’ holiday. 
We stayed in hotels not less than 3 star whilst touring Cornwall and on the 
way back to Helen in Cricklade we stopped at Princetown. 
The cottages were still there although the station had been shut down.
</p>

<p>
I knocked at the door of the house I thought we used to live in, 
a flustered elderly lady came to the door. 
I explained that I thought I used to live there and my name was Kingdon and she 
immediately said “you’re Jim Kingdon’s son”.
</p>

<p>
She was French’s daughter, her father dead and herself widowed and that very 
day was moving to Plymouth to be near her daughter. 
In spite of still gathering the bits and pieces together for the removal men, 
she insisted on us coming in and made us a cup of tea.
</p>

<p>
We did not like to stay too long as she was obviously in a state of removal 
confusion but the short visit was to me a very pleasing and unexpected link with the past
</p>

<p>
My father said in later years that the four years spent at Princetown were among
the happiest in his life. 
The wage could not have been all that good as almost immediately we took a lodger –
Mr. Gilbart a headmaster of a small Dartmoor village school (I believe it was Mary Tavy). 
He became not only my father’s mentor but a very good friend until he died less than 41 years old.
</p>

<p>
Many years later when my father was retired and living at Bristol he showed me 
a couple of letters he had kept from Mr. Gilbart. 
The letters were serious but warm and friendly, the emphasis on religion and 
one of them a long account of his struggles with his conscience re the Christian and War. 
He had decided to become a Conscientious Objector which he did, 1914-18, and I 
believe, but am not certain he spent some time in Princetown Prison.
</p>

<p>
I have only a very dim recollection of him, but I heard so much about him from 
my parents that I have always thought I really knew him.
</p>

<p>
In the centre of the village opposite the Duchy Hotel was the village store, a
veritable village Selfridges selling everything. I can remember it as a child and thought it was huge. 
It was owned by a man called Weeks who had several daughters one of whom Mr. Gilbart married.
</p>

<p>
As far as I can gather the Wesleyan Methodist Church and the village stores were 
the centre of the religious and social life of the village. 
The Weeks were warm, generous people, great Methodists and they too befriended and 
helped my father who was now a member of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. 
It was now, encouraged by Gilbart and Weeks that he became a Lay Preacher of the 
Wesleyan Methodist Church.
</p>

<p>
This meant that Sundays, not every Sunday, he would go off to a little chapel 
in one of the isolated Dartmoor villages and ‘carry the Gospel’ sorry ‘Carry the 
message of the Gospel’ based on the infallible book The Bible.
</p>

<p>
I do know that his real education was being broadened by Mr. Gilbart. 
Certain simple phrases stick in my memory ‘we talked a lot’, ‘we studied together’.
</p>

<p>
Since from his letters Gilbart was cultured and educated, probably a graduate, one
can make a guess at the topics – certainly Darwin, probably Trade Unionism and
Christianity, the Social System and Christianity, day to day politics. 
I do know that my father started to broaden his mind, examine new ideas.
