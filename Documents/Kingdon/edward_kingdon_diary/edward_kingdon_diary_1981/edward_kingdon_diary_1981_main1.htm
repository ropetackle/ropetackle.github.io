<h3 class="main">January</h3>

<h4 class="main">
1st Jan
</h4>

<p>
A sunny morning. Did some garden tidying fuschias and roses. Stanley Clifford
arrived with barrow load of rubbish to burn. He is 81 now. Shot a woodcock in
one of his pre-Christmas shoots – only the second in his long life. Marjorie
busy with washing.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
2nd Jan
</h4>

<p>
3 pm. By the fireside waiting for the milkman.
</p>

<p>
Marjorie remembers the name of our first milkman in Chadwell Heath 1930 - ? The
small dairies had not yet disappeared and Mr Flowers was a worthy representative
– an authority on the Gulf Stream. Whatever the weather the Gulf Stream came
into it. His shop was in Mill Lane, a dairy cum grocer’s. Mrs Margam, a
colleague at Green Lane School, was the wife of a dairyman. Their shop was in
the City of Westminster which they had taken on in the late twenties, their
business in Maesteg, S Wales having failed due to the miners’ strike and the
continuing unemployment.
</p>

<p>
Horses still drew the carts, milk, bread and coal and as far as I can recollect
I was still rushing out with bucket and shovel until at least 1945 to collect
their manurial droppings.
</p>

<p>
Horse troughs, water carts and steam rollers, the three go together in my
memories of childhood. All towns and villages had horse troughs, usually placed
in a wide part of the thoroughfare, preferably in the square if there was one.
The one at Decoy was the centre of our favourite playground. It was filled with
water from the water cart, one of its three duties. Its 2nd duty was to wet the
stones and road, the steam roller following. The 3rd duty was to ‘Lay the
dust’ in summer, the roads being only crushed stone and very dusty indeed
especially if the summer was exceptionally hot and dry.
</p>

<p>
I’d like to come across a picture of Shire Horses drinking from one of those
troughs.
</p>

<p>
Vivid childhood memory – 1910 or 11 – two shire horses attached to a
brewers’ dray, drinking from the trough and the water sinking rapidly, then
the urination. I had never seen such a cataract. I ran home to tell my Mum. She
said it was neither nice to watch or to talk about such things.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
3rd Jan
</h4>

<p>
Ethel called with cheerful good will and 12 lbs of cooking apples.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
4th Jan
</h4>

<p>
11 am. Stanley taken to Cheltenham Hospital, suspected stomach and bowel
trouble.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
5th Jan
</h4>

<p>
Started Jane’s chess table, cutting out names of Jane and Andy. Letters J. A.
N. completed.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
6th Jan
</h4>

<p>
Stanley comfortable. X-rayed, result not known.
</p>

<p>
Did some more marquetry E. A. N. D. Y.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
7th Jan
</h4>

<p>
Went up to Little Rissington’s wood yard. Unable to get wood of the width I
required.
</p>

<p>
Carried on with marquetry. WIRRAL.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Jan 31st
</h4>

<p>
Jan. has been an exceptionally mild month. Unable to celebrate Marjorie’s
birthday (29th) 76. Have been feeling as weak as during my worst period at
Chadwell Heath.
</p>

<p>
Marjorie has managed amazingly well. We seem to complement one another. Long may
it continue.
</p>

<p>
Stanley’s trouble was bowel not cancer, cure – to eat more roughage and
greens. Must write to Ian warning him of possible trouble when he gets to 81.
Good medicine to read the birthday letters to Marjorie.
</p>

<h3 class="main">February</h3>

<h4 class="main">
Feb 11th
</h4>

<p>
Much better now. A day of sunshine. Sowed broad beans and then sat on seat on
patio and enjoyed whisky and sun in appropriate quantities.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Feb 13th
</h4>

<p>
Another day of sunshine. Planted onion sets and covered with old window frames.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Feb 15th
</h4>

<p>
Wrote to Jane on her 21st birthday on the 8th. Sent it off early due to the
vagaries of the post.
</p>

<p>
Have written to Ian today. His letter to us on Laba’s birthday was the best he
has written to us – an alive account of his visit to the Wirral – a week end
he obviously enjoyed immensely.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Feb 16th
</h4>

<p>
An SOS from the Cliffords. Both down with bronchitis and sickness.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Feb 23rd
</h4>

<p>
Have been down shopping for the Cliffords. Both much better now but still
confined to the house. Claire, Swiss by birth, German speaking and still talks
English with a very pronounced accent.
</p>

<p>
Her “Victorian” tale. Grandmother born in 1853 had 14 children. “Ah”
said I “women were worn out by middle age”
</p>

<p>
“Not her” said Claire “She lived to be 90. Strong farming Swiss stock and
she ruled the family with a rod of iron. Children were not allowed to speak at
the meal table, must eat all the food that was put in front of them and all
misdemeanours were punished by being shut in a dark cupboard – mit only
themselves for company” said Claire “And everybody had to work, each his
allotted task and that is how my mother brought me up”.
</p>

<p>
“Yes” interrupts Stanley “and that is how she is now, always ratching
around dusting and it won’t be long before we’re dust” says Stanley
mournfully.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Feb 24th
</h4>

<p>
Finished Jane’s chess table and as usual dissatisfied – very conscious of
its imperfections. Mum says that it looks very nice but I see only the faults.
</p>

<p>
One of the books I am now reading is Thackeray’s <i>Virginians</i>. Surprised
to come across the word ‘Shoplifting’ which I had assumed to be a modern
euphemism.
</p>

<p>
On Saturday night 21-22nd heaviest fall of snow and continued on Sunday to a
depth of at least 6 in. Read that some of the Cotswold roads were blocked
including the A40.
</p>

<p>
Snow still about even though the thaw has set in.
</p>

<p>
Forgot to record the first yellow crocus Jan. 29th at edge of patio. A week in
front of the others. Why? Heredity enjoyment or what?
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Feb 26th
</h4>

<p>
Antique clock collected from Johnny the Junk, repaired for £3.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Feb 28th
</h4>

<p>
Phone call from Helen. Pleased with her £500 birthday gift which will go
towards her new suite, £850 reduced to £700.
</p>

<p>
Wedding arrangements all under control and invitations sent out. Laba and I are
beginning to get excited about it and looking forward to seeing our grand
daughter married on May 9th. Have not replied to Jane’s letter as we expect to
hear from her re visit on the first week-end in March.
</p>

<p>
The last day of Feb, an exceptionally dry month ending in snow, bitterly cold
and no sun. Only go out on Thursdays to collect the pension and do the weekly
shopping.
</p>

<h3 class="main">March</h3>

<h4 class="main">
March 2nd
</h4>

<p>
Phone call from Lawley’s, the Cheltenham China shop telling us that the three
extra pieces ordered to go with Jane’s Silver Birch tea set were arrived. They
were ordered five months ago, Sept 29th 1980. If that is the way foreign orders
are treated no wonder we are losing our overseas markets.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 5th
</h4>

<p>
Cheltenham and collected one milk jug, one sugar basin and one bread and butter
plate, each piece £6-40; when ordered 5 months ago - £5-50.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 7th
</h4>

<p>
First daffodils out, as last year the ones in the shelter of the lavender bush,
also first blossom on almond tree and a lovely carpet of snowdrops for a month
or more now.
</p>

<p>
Wondering whether Jane and Andy will turn up this week-end. Laba has got in
extra food.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 9th
</h4>

<p>
Phone call from Jane, unable to come. Had been to Ilkley to be present at the
first reading of the banns. Feels that she and Andy should be present. Sounded
bright and cheerful, doing some voluntary social work. Andy has had promotion
Stoke- on Trent and Manchester Areas. Interested in all the wedding preparations
and the Amsterdam honeymoon. Thought she might take more “O” levels this
coming Autumn. A growing maturity is very noticeable. Fancies doing social work.
Whatever Jane decides to do she can and will.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 10th
</h4>

<p>
Neighbour Joan Summers’ saga continues. All past buying and selling came to
naught. House on market again at £55,000 and has paid a deposit on a flat in a
country house in Brockhampton which Barretts the builders are converting into
flats. It stands in 7 acres of grounds and Barretts have offered to buy 6 Gorse
Meadow at what price has not yet been disclosed. If one of them had to go I find
myself wishing that it was Donnie the Doc who had been the surviving one. It is
said that friendships are very difficult to make in old age. We became very
friendly and I still feel sad at his death, missing him very much.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 11th
</h4>

<p>
Have been reading a book by Lord Elton, bought it several months ago in Sue
Ryder’s Charity Shop. In the 30’s I heard him give a talk on the Radio and
it is the only bit of radio that I remember through the years. I never forgot
his name, nor his subject “It is the small things in life that are
important”. At the time I thought it was the meanderings of the decadent
aristocracy only concerned with the trivial except in one respect, the
determination to hang on to their position of privilege. Now, like the wise old
Lord, I too think that the small things in life are the most important.
</p>

<p>
On the 9th wrote to Joy and Albert and visited Ann Drew who is in hospital
again, found unconscious on kitchen floor. It looks as if Ann will not be able
to live on her own any more. Gave her a bottle of whisky, my cure for all ills
and was pleased to note a little animation in her response. I used to visit her
mother when she was 98 and enjoyed sharing her breakfast with her at 11 am –
whisky in hot water and dry bread.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 14th
</h4>

<p>
Marjorie not well with severe back and stomach pains, probably caused by helping
me to lift a sack of potatoes out of the car boot. No appetite.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 16th
</h4>

<p>
Marjorie improving, resting mostly in bed.
</p>

<p>
A fine day – rare this month. Tried a new method of sowing parsnips – made
holes with dibber and sowed 2 or 3 seeds at the top of the refilled hole
–economical, not much thinning to do and the hope that the resulting parsnips
will find their way downwards straight and true.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 17th
</h4>

<p>
Walked to hospital to visit Anne. Found her subdued and dispirited. Also went in
men’s ward to see John Goodfellow, an ex teacher and pub acquaintance. Shocked
to see him – hardening of brain arteries, affecting speech, concentration and
balance. Looks a very old man – 73.
</p>

<p>
On the way back called in at New Inn, almost empty. Reg, Phil’s Rissington
cousin eating pie and chips. Been redundant since October, wife working.
Wondered why he could not have had a snack at home at a fraction of the price?
</p>

<p>
Gave me a lift home in his car!!
</p>

<p>
Found Bob Sterry waiting for me to sign his unemployment form. Reg an unemployed
painter and decorator and Bob a ditto sub postmaster.
</p>

<p>
Unemployment for some cannot be in any way the same as it was in the thirties.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 18th
</h4>

<p>
Dibbed in another row of parsnips. Ground drying out with no rain and cool
winds.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 19th
</h4>

<p>
Mr Hunter, the sweep, passed on the following Cotswold weather lore “The
direction of the wind on the 21st will be the prevailing one for the following 3
months”.
</p>

<p>
Marjorie much better.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 20th
</h4>

<p>
Called on Stanley Clifford with parsnips, cabbage, swede and leeks. I like
hearing Stanley’s high pitched, almost falsetto voice, complaining that the
country is going to the dogs.
</p>

<p>
Thinking of selling another ten acres of land which he retained when he sold his
farm at Harford. Contains a spring which has never dried up – very good
pasture land, hoping to get £2,000 an acre for it. Insisted on me having a
whisky but was so busy complaining of the recent budget increase that he forgot
to tip the bottle and I had to enjoy sipping an anaemic glass of water.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 21st
</h4>

<p>
Am. wind South to South East with plenty of rain but does this auger a warm May
and June?
</p>

<p>
Pm. wind veered to South West, gale force with rain, worse day of the year to
date.
</p>

<h4 class="main">

<p>
Surprise – enjoyed Bartok’s opera Bluebeard’s Castle on Tele.
</p>

<p>
Surprise – just found out that Charles Reade’s novel <i>It is Never too Late
to Mend </i>is a plea for Victorian prison reform.
</p>

<p>
Still waiting for the rest of the daffodils to open out.
</p>

<p>
The heathers make a lovely purplish red carpet in the front. Our best gardening
buy 13 years ago. Flowering from mid December to April.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 24th
</h4>

<p>
Runner beans sown in pots in cold frame. Marjorie visited Ann Drew in hospital.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 25th
</h4>

<p>
‘House’ day. Joan Summers called in to tell us she would be moving on 13th
April. Gorse Meadow bought by Barretts, the building firm and she has bought one
of their flats in Brockhampton. No further information of prices but guess about
£50.000 for both.
</p>

<p>
Then Marjorie Moore in the afternoon. Their terrace house now on the market for
£32,000 and she and Kenneth looking for a home in Cheltenham area. Both ladies
very stimulated by house buying and selling.
</p>

<p>
Parsnips sown.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 26th
</h4>

<p>
Went to Brockhampton, taking Marjorie Moore. All agreed a lovely position but
not impressed by the converted flats.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 27th
</h4>

<p>
Letter from Helen arrived as Jane was phoning from Wirral. Both gave us a
feeling of joie-de-vivre. Jane was excited that she had got a job, starting
Monday with a car firm, Mercedes, in Liverpool. Ian now a member of the Golf
Club.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 28th
</h4>

<p>
Sowed Swedes.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 29th
</h4>

<p>
Sowed peas. Broad beans appearing and all the daffodils now in full bloom.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 30th
</h4>

<p>
More broad beans sown. Noon, rain came and lasted all day. Wind changed to N-NE,
altering the pattern since 21st.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
March 31st
</h4>

<p>
Took car into Cheltenham to be serviced £60. Low cloud over the top of the
Cotswolds, found driving unpleasant and the price for a full service even more
so. Had a pleasant hour with Mr Heynes the bookseller with whom I have two
interests in common, books and whisky.
</p>

<p>
Bought several books including one by Winterbotham <i>Moderum Alterum</i>. Mr. Heynes said he was a solicitor, his sister a former Mayor of Cheltenham.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday had the last of the brussel sprouts and this week will see the last of
the savoys.

<p>
Cheltenham. Marjorie and I enjoyed exploring the area off Bath Rd. Saw the
property the Moores have viewed, a nice area for a town house. Went in the
Queen’s Hotel. Surprise – Guinness 2p cheaper than in the Star.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 3rd
</h4>

<p>
First cut of grass this year, not before time. Stanley joined me. Said he could
not remember a year when grass was so good. There spoke an ex dairy farmer. Also
bemoaned the influence of the EEC, dairy herds disappearing as a result of their
policy. Almost expected him to have tears of sorrow rather than anger. Spoke
reverently of cows as if they were members of his family.
</p>

Too cold for garden. Watched boat race – first woman cox Sue Brown of Honiton
for Oxford.

<p>
Census form collected by young Civil Servant. Gave him a cup of tea.
Indiscreetly told us that he had had some awkward moments with Council tenants,
including abuse.
</p>

<p>
Bob Sterry called. Purity Taylor not too well, caught a chill. Am still signing
his dole forms.
</p>

<h4 class="main">

<p>
Posted letters to Olive and Violet whose birthday it is on the 8th. Violet now
76, Olive 75 and Gordon 80, with Annie, Norman’s wife 84.
</p>

<p>
Still enjoying the Victorian’s intoxication with words. In Hawthorne’s <i>Transformation
</i>for example appears this delightful adjective ‘eleemosynary’,
‘throwing food for the flock of eleemosynary doves’.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 13th

<p>
Our neighbour Joan Summers left for Brockhampton. Wonder who our new neighbours
will be? Do not like change, increasingly so as we grow older.
</p>

<h4 class="main">

<p>
Watched on television the return of America’s space shuttle “Columbia”,
the first to be usable again.

<h4 class="main">
April 15th

<p>
Bob Sterry, Denise Shields and I went to Solicitor Davis to get ideas as to how
to stop our neighbour Mr Breakill from property development of his garden. Very
useful. Nothing to pay as Bob and Bob the Solicitor old friends.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 16th
</h4>

<p>
Mum and I visited Anne in hospital. Wants to return home, probably next week.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 17th
</h4>

<p>
Went trout feeding with Stanley. Have not seen so many trout since a boy.
</p>

<p>
“Tickled” trout in the trout streams as a small boy but cannot remember ever
“tickling” one. Tickling meant lying flat on your belly on the small bridge
across the stream, place your hand in the water palm upwards, wait for a trout
to cover the palm, jerk the arm upwards and hope to flick the astonished trout
on the bank.
</p>

<p>
These trout in Stanley’s brother’s lake are fed daily at 6 pm. A fascinating
sight , dozens of trout jumping out of the water and coming up under the bellies
of complaining ducks with a distinct buffet, frightening them away.
</p>

<p>
Stanley grieved that he had not bought the land although he had the chance.
“Fifteen feet depth of sand covering 20 acres and a royalty on each load”
moaned Stanley.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 18th
</h4>

<p>
Cut grass having put weed killer on the lawn four days ago. Wrote to Ian.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 19th
</h4>

<p>
Composed letter to Planning Officer, voicing objections to building on adjacent
land.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 21st
</h4>

<p>
Stanley called with his letter, stayed two hours, a fund of tales all delivered
in his serious, humourless manner. Many unconsciously funny.
</p>

<p>
“Major Cooke, owner of farm land adjacent to us, in RAF in First World War.
Taken prisoner by the Turks, tortured and castrated. He learnt his farming with
us. Can speak eight languages and Claire says he can speak German without a
trace of accent. Another of his languages is Arabic. A very clever man. Do you
know he used to go walking with the masters of Cheltenham College and they
couldn’t learn him nothing” concluded Stanley triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
Stanley’s first car was the three wheeler Morgan, no reversing gear, given to
him by his wealthy and eccentric female neighbour who farmed 5000 acres. She
lived in a big farm house, in a big kitchen with a big fire place which she
shared with twenty four goats. I particularly enjoyed the exactitude of the
number.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 23rd
</h4>

<p>
A letter from Jane, probably the last from Miss Jane Marshall and so closes the
Anthology which I have conscientiously kept all these years. Still find the
reading of it fascinating and am sure Helen will find it equally so.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 24th

<p>
Bob and I in his car drove to Cirencester to deliver 5 letters of protest to
Planning Officer. Am seeing much more of Bob since he has given up the post
Office. Born in the Forest of Dean at St Briavels. His mother was pregnant at
Cymmer, they returned to the Forest in order that he might be born in the home
of his Ancestors.
</p>

<h4 class="main">

<p>
Sense of triumph, managed to get down the fence panel without aid in order to
paint the oil tank. Taking advantage of the house next door being empty. Put
rust proofing on. Start painting tomorrow.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 26th
</h4>

<p>
Woke to find no electricity, deep snow and a gale force blizzard. Had to go out
to get coal, felt ill and cold but managed to light fire and boil water for a
cup of tea. Writing this at 7.30pm and still no electricity, nor telephone.
Looks as if we will have no electric blanket tonight. Tried to contact Anne as
we had invited her to dinner, no phone and we are house bound because of the
cold and the snow. Have never seen our fir trees spread-eagled as they have been
today by the gale force winds from the north. I’m afraid our chimney sweep’s
folk lore is on a loser so far, as the wind has persisted N-NE for most of
April.
</p>

<p>
Looking back I find no reference to Ian’s letter post marked 11th April. There
should have been as we were both very impressed with the improvement in literacy
and liveliness.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 27th
</h4>

<p>
Went to bed last night at 10.30pm having spent a very enjoyable evening warm and
cosy by the coal fire, the room lit by the flickering flames, free of the modern
drug Television. Like two good Victorians we carried our lighted candle up the
stairs, deciding to share the same bed to combat the modern fashionable
complaint for old people – hypothermia.
</p>

<p>
Woke at 6.30am to find electricity restored, no more snow fallen but the wind
still strong and bitterly cold.
</p>

<p>
Reminisced a lot about Helen and the children as we sat by the fire and also out
own childhood. Mum gave a lovely, charming, jolly and unselfconscious laugh when
the word hypothermia recalled to her the time when there were not less than
three sleeping to a bed and she sometimes found herself on the floor, heaved
there by sister Dolly’s not inconsiderable bum.
</p>

<p>
Her face took on a lovely expression and seemed quite young and girlish in the
fire light. We felt very close.
</p>

<p>
Tried to telephone Anne, no luck. If we are not housebound by mid day will try
to drive the car there.
</p>

<p>
I am still enjoying my Victorian literature and am formulating the theory that
the ability to read and write was much more widespread among the ‘lower
orders’ than is so often suggested.
</p>

<p>
I have a Volume on Tennyson compiled by his son, consisting mostly of letters
written to and written by him.
</p>

<p>
One letter from a lady states that she has been to see an “old cottager” who
was in service in his Aunt’s house when Tennyson was a youth, “and she still
reads avidly everything she can about Master Alfred”.
</p>

<p>
Tennyson writes to a working man thanking him for the poems he has sent him and
is pleased that he is getting so much solace and pleasure from his efforts.
</p>

<p>
He also writes to an old blacksmith in Sheffield in similar vein.
</p>

<p>
Tennyson was born in 1809 so it is fair to assume that these people were born
too in the first quarter of the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p>
John Bright writes to the working men’s club (Rochdale) in mid Century. Again
it is reasonable to suppose that there was more than one man able to read his
letters.
</p>

<p>
Was the Victorian definition of literacy a classical education?
</p>

<p>
On television a play entitled <i>Blood and Bread </i>has a young shepherd
reading the Bible. The play is supposed to be based on the tales of an old
shepherd living in the 1820’s and 1830’s.
</p>

<p>
I have been asking people lately if they can remember learning to read and
almost without exception the answer is basically no.
</p>

<p>
It seems to imply that the ability to read can be acquired almost as easily as
the ability to speak and it seems unreasonable to assume that those with above
average intelligence in the “lower orders” did not exercise every ingenuity
to acquire this skill.
</p>

<p>
And what about those of us of average intelligence – the same in spite of no
compulsory education?
</p>

<p>
Which brings me to the below average who do find difficulty. In spite of the
millions spent on education, there is a hidden minority who are illiterate. From
my own experience I would suggest a minimum of ten percent, and that is not
counting the subnormal and dyslexic.
</p>

<p>
Is there some quirk in their brain which cannot acquire the abstract, as I like
to term it, for obviously to them letters seem to be a mysterious code which
they find difficult to translate into concrete sounds.

<p>
Going back to my own experience I found only one answer – repetition. Speech
was learnt by repetition, why not letters. Although frowned upon by modern
educational theory it produced results as well as a sense of achievement.
Learning through discovery gets nowhere with these unfortunates, they not only
get left behind but they get lost – a tragedy.
</p>

<p>
Only one complete failure – Harry Keeble aged 11 who after one full week of
chanting alone or with the class, singing it, shouting it, whispering it,
dancing it, every conceivable way to give variety C-A-T, CAT failed to pass the
test on Friday afternoon. I pointed to the letter C, Harry’s face beamed and
in a loud voice he said “Ku for pussy”.
</p>

<p>
The blind leading the blind; if we could only understand, their apparent
stupidity could be overcome. Anyway until we do repetition does achieve results.
</p>

<p>
The Victorian Era was a great age for “tracts”, free or at the most 1d,
mainly religious and political. The tinkers carried tracts to villages and
hamlets all over the country. There must have been a number of people to read
them produced in such quantities. The Bible seems to be the one book at least
that the ‘lower orders’ did acquire. The novelists do not stress the
inability of servants etc to read but frequently mention them reading and
writing notes and letters.
</p>

<p>
The morning is improving so will go to fetch Ann to dinner, i.e. if she can
come. She did and took her back home in the evening.

May 3rd
</h4>

<p>
Set off at 6.10am from Bourton, a very hard frost, grieved for my geraniums
which I had rashly planted out yesterday. Via Coventry, M69, M1 to Leeds. Very
little traffic, mainly dry, cold and windy. Took 4 hrs. including 2 stop, very
pleasing for a 74 yr. old but felt tired and glad to arrive safely. Helen,
Robin, Jane and Ian there to greet us. Very nice feeling ‘to be in the warmth
of their bosoms’.
</p>

<p>
All looked well except that Jane was feeling the effects of the previous night,
not getting to bed until after 3am. Andy was in London with Pete and I assume
having a similar strenuous evening. Heard all the news about the wedding prep.
and Ian put on his new suit, shoes etc looking quite an aristocratic young man.
He is maturing rapidly now.
</p>

<p>
Peggy joined us at dinner. She did not seem so well as at Christmas, small
appetite, but the rest of us did justice to Helen’s excellent dinner, clean
plates, no waste.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
May 4th
</h4>

<p>
Jane’s rehearsal morning trying on her wedding gown with Nicola in her
bridesmaid’s dress assisting and Helen supervising. Jane looked lovely, very
young and pretty in the lovely white dress and veil, a perfect fit. Helen put on
her new outfit for the wedding and Mum and I thought how attractive she looked.
She keeps remarkably young looking. Laba and I too put on our wedding apparel.
Laba’s floral dress, black velvet jacket and pink hat last worn for Sheila’s
wedding looked very good and I do not think we will disgrace our children,
although I am having difficulty in getting the paint stains out of my boiler
suit.
</p>

<p>
Andy arrived later from London, liked the table I had made for them.
</p>

<p>
Did our usual tour of the town, resting at Betty’s and the Lister’s.
</p>

<p>
In the evening when the rest had gone to bed Helen and I sat chatting. We feel
very close to one another, precious moments for me. Suggestion raised again that
we should come up to Ilkley. Will do so.
</p>

<p>
Jane and Andy had been to Leeds. In the evening heard much of how everybody was
getting involved in the wedding, expecting 52 guests. Cards and presents
arriving. Gave them our gift of £500.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
May 6th
</h4>

<p>
Gave Helen and Robin £500 towards wedding expenses. A sunny day, able to sit
outside the Lister’s.
</p>

<p>
Went up to the Golf Course with Ian, second day in succession. Thoroughly
enjoyed it. If he sticks at it should become a good golfer. 49 yesterday, 45
today, good for a beginner.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
May 7th
</h4>

<p>
Joined by Andy and Jane at the Lister’s. We liked him very much and enjoyed
his company. Talked about their plans for the future and we were pleased to hear
that when he has become more established and also a few years older they hope to
start a family – great grandparents – lovely.
</p>

<p>
Just Laba and I and Susie 8pm in the house. Helen teaching, the rest down at the
Parish Church rehearsing for Sat. Robin giving the bride, Andy receiving, Pete
best manning, Nicola bridesmaiding, Ian ushering and the Vicar presiding.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
May 8th
</h4>

<p>
Wedding eve, sunny day, Jane and Andy more relaxed, looking forward to tomorrow,
all preparations completed. Evening spent at the Troutbeck and Craiglands with
our Joy and Albert, Andy’s family. Jane with us but Andy with the lads.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
May 9th
</h4>

<p>
Wedding day. Dull, threatening rain.
</p>

<p>
6.30am Robin with tea. Felt excited.
</p>

<p>
By 9.30am all of us in wedding clothes, Jane looking particularly lovely. Nicola
and Sue, Jane’s bridesmaids had arrived and a real festive atmosphere
developing. It was a stroke of genius on Helen’s part to invite the neighbours
to view the bride and toast her before the ceremony. Joined by Joy and Albert
who took Mum and me to the Church for the 11 o’clock service. About 70 – 80
people in the Church, a thrill for us when Jane walked down the aisle on the arm
of her dad. We found the Church service very moving and Jane and Andy looked so
much in harmony that to me the service had a depth and meaning which I shall
always remember.
</p>

<p>
From where we sat I could not see Jane’s face but Andy was in profile and his
loving, caring expression as he looked at Jane made a deep impression. The Vicar
is to be congratulated for helping to make it such a moving occasion.
</p>

<p>
When the service was over photos were taken outside the Church, not only by the
professional photographer but also by numerous amateurs of whom Ian was one.
There was no wind, no rain but no sun.
</p>

<p>
Albert drove Joy, Laba and me to the reception at the Troutbeck where the bride
and groom and their parents greeted the guests, sherry provided and a happy
atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
About 2pm, dined in a lovely room, making a delightful setting for bride, groom
and guests. A very colourful scene with the tables beautifully layed.
</p>

<p>
The bride and groom were the last to appear and were greeted by thunderous
clapping as they made their way to the top table. Again I was moved and dropped
a tear in my wine glass.
</p>

<p>
Now the eats. Prawn Cocktail for starters and Joy who was sitting next to me
said “There are prawn cocktails and prawn cocktails, this is delicious” and
Joy knows as she loves her belly.
</p>

<p>
Then beef, ham, chicken, pork pie, variety of salads, creams and sauces, all
freshly prepared and served with red and white wine.
</p>

<p>
Then sherry trifle and or fruit followed by coffee and nobody enjoyed it more
than Mum and me.
</p>

<p>
Jane and Andy looked a lovely couple, cutting the cake another tear dropped in
my wine and then the toasts.
</p>

<p>
There were three speakers – Robin, Andy and Pete the best man and I don’t
think I have ever heard three consecutive speeches which harmonised so much,
setting just the right note and expressing that deep feeling on such a joyful
occasion.
</p>

<p>
Robin, the first speaker excelled himself, an excellent speech as was Andy’s
and Pete.
</p>

<p>
Then an enjoyable hour in the lounge bar, during which time the lads completely
obliterated the going away car with signs and symbols, stuck on with shaving
cream.
</p>

<p>
And then for me a moving farewell, Jane embracing me with deep feeling, the
tears streaming down her face. Into the car with Andy and off to Leeds Airport
for their honeymoon in Amsterdam.
</p>

<p>
Then back to the house for tea and chat, the two families, Joy and Albert and
Sheila and George. I think Helen deserves the thanks of all us for making it
such a harmonious occasion. She was the Queen Pin.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
May 10th
</h4>

<p>
Met J and A at the Troutbeck for a pre lunch drink. Then Helen’s roast beef
dinner, served on the “Duke of Bavaria’s China”, eight of us and eight
sets of crockery for the 3 courses. A man of foresight is the Duke. The eight
were Helen, Robin, Ian, Peggy, Joy, Albert, Mum and I.
</p>

<p>
Ian, nice thought, suggested taking a photo of Joy, Albert, Mum and me and ended
up taking several of us all, as a group, in the back garden.
</p>

<p>
Late afternoon Joy and Albert left for Chadwell Heath. Helen said spontaneously
“I cannot remember a happier time”. She spoke for all of us.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
May 11th
</h4>

<p>
Did a bit of preliminary house hunting – a glorious summer day.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
May 12th
</h4>

<p>
Went to Burley and Menston house hunting, preferred Menston.
</p>

<p>
Returned to find Helen had collected the proofs of the wedding photos, all very
good. Set us off again on Wedding Talk.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
May 13th
</h4>

<p>
Went to Photographers, spent two hours there and £87. Bought two antique frames
for photos of Jane and Andy in the Church, and Jane, Andy, Mum and me in the
Church porch and the “Bronte” photo in a gilt frame which we presented to
Helen and Robin. About 6 smaller photos completed our purchase.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
May 14th
</h4>

<p>
Photos Ian had taken arrived. He is to be congratulated on the results. We all
thought they were very good and are especially valuable as they cover aspects of
the week-end not covered by the professional photographer.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
May 15th
</h4>

<p>
More house hunting, choice limited. Houses more expensive than in Bourton. Must
get something reasonably near the shops, yet on the flat.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
May 16th
</h4>

<p>
Jane and Andy returned from their honeymoon, good weather, good Amsterdam and
good time. It was a treat to see them so happy.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
May 17th
</h4>

<p>
Left at 5am for Bourton and arrived home about 9am. Felt tired and did nothing
for the rest of the day except a quick look at the garden. Geraniums had
survived the frost but looked poorly and the beans and peas had not grown much.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
May 18th
</h4>

<p>
Took it easy again. Severe pain in both arms and neck.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
May 25th
</h4>

<p>
A weeks’ rest, much better. Feel like doing some decorating to “bootify”
the house.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
May 30th

<p>
Finished lounge and kitchen between us.

<p>
Been so busy, have had no time for diary entries. Will have to work backwards.
</p>

<p>
Today survey of “Mayfields” Ilkley arrived, seems satisfactory. Bill £97.75.
</p>

<p>
14th May <i>[14th June?]</i> Joy and Albert arrived and went back on Wednesday.
They gave us such an excellent time that we felt that we were the ones on
holiday. Apart from Sunday dinner they insisted on having all meals out except
for breakfast which Joy insisted on cooking and they brought a supply of food,
fruit, bacon, eggs, cake, tin food which we still have and whisky and sherry
which has been sampled.
</p>

<p>
We did the Slaughters including Lords of the Manor Hotel, Stow, Moreton-in-Marsh,
Broadway, Cleeve Hill, Cheltenham and their generosity – their care for and of
us touched us very much. A cheerful, happy, loving and very memorable visit.
</p>

<p>
We had not long been back from Ilkley, wedding, Helen phoned excitedly from
Ilkley that a house in Middleton was on the market. Robin came down on the 7th
and took us to Ilkley on the 8th. It gave us a good feeling that they cared so
much and were going to such trouble to fix us up.
</p>

<p>
Monday afternoon viewed the house Mayfield, Robin taking us and conducting us
over it as he and Helen had already viewed it. Liked it but felt apprehensive
and worried, I don’t know why – old age I suppose and by Tuesday morning had
decided not to buy. Changed our minds again thanks to Helen’s advocacy and
went to view it again. Getting used to the idea. Going at £52,000 offered £50,000
and went to the agents to settle it – Thornton’s.
</p>

<p>
Helen and Robin brought us back on the 10th and returned the same day. Glad that
they had been so persuasive, we needed that as it had come so suddenly on our
successful efforts to sell. That had left us a bit drained and we would have
liked to have sat back and collected ourselves again for the next step. However
now it is done there is a great feeling of relief.
</p>

<p>
The verbal news, I like to call them Indian smoke signals which we put out last
the week in May soon brought results. A Mr and Mrs Dean from Charlton Kings
came, liked the house and on their second visit clinched the deal £49,750 we
having asked £50,000, solicitor John Barkes of Morton-in Marsh, acting for both
of us and JB will be acting for us in the buying of Mayfield.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday I saw Pat the cow girl and she said she would like our house. Had to
tell her it was sold.

<p>
One of Jane’s long letters, full of ‘joie’ and parties and plans and news
that she and Andy would be coming to see us on 26th for the week-end
</p>

<p>
A story from Joy and Albert:-
</p>

<div align="center">
  <center>

  <p>
  <b>Albut Unkel and Joy Anti</b>
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>or Racial Harmony</b>
  </p>

  </center>
</div>

<blockquote>
  Mr and Mrs Patel, Indians, religion Hindu, have taken over the sub Post Office
  and news agents in the High Rd near Joy and Albert and have become friendly
  with Joy and Albert. Their children call them Albert Uncle and Joy Aunty. Joy
  sometimes does some shopping for Mrs Patel especially the buying of
  vegetables.<br />
  A niece of the Patel’s was married recently, the ceremony and reception held
  at Barking Town Hall. The Asians of Forest Gate and Manor Park were there in
  full force and among the few white guests invited were Joy and Albert and
  their wedding invitation was addressed “Albert Unkel and Joy Anti”.<br />
  At the ceremony Joy was given a place of honour on the stage with the women
  relatives and intimate friends, the men and the rest of the guests standing or
  sitting in the body of the hall. The ceremony etc lasted from 1.30pm –
  5.30pm and Joy enjoyed it immensely but I suspect that Albert did not enjoy it
  so much as motor cars.

<p>
Ian gave us a film show in the evening. Enjoyed it very much. Seems to be taking
his “O” levels in his stride. I think his golf and photography is helping
him to keep a sense of balance.

<p>
Phoned Helen re Mayfields and she has offered to go there again to see how our
furniture fits.
</p>

<h4 class="main">

<p>
Jane and Andy due to arrive at 8pm. Arrived about 8.30pm, tired but happy.
Brought the wedding album with them. Enjoyed looking at the photos again
especially as we had not seen most of them in colour. Heard Jane’s tale of
bargaining (a la Grandad) having bought a picture in Liverpool for £20 a
reduction of £5-95.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
June 27th
</h4>

<p>
Late breakfast. Jane and Andy went to village, Laba and I did house and garden
jobs and Laba prepared a pork chop evening meal with trifle to follow, Good
appetites.
</p>

<p>
Went to the Lords of the Manor at the Slaughters in the evening. A treat for us
as we rarely go out in the evening. Andy is such pleasant, easy company and
Jane’s cheerful chatter we find very entertaining.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
June 28th
</h4>

<p>
Youngsters got up late. Seemed pleases to accept some of our bits and pieces –
an oak wardrobe door with mirror, bought when we married in 1930 at Harrison
Gibson’s Ilford, a heavy weight food mixer given to me by Doc., a coffee
percolator given to Robin when he left May and Bakers and then given to us, an
old blazer of Helen’s which delighted Jane, a lawn edge cutter which we had
found too heavy to use, a brass spraying pump in need of repair, a lawn turf
cutter needs sharpening, a hoe and a small garden trowel.
</p>

<p>
The three of us went to the Talbot at Stow for a drink and returned with good
appetites to eat Laba’s chicken dinner.
</p>

<p>
Jane and Andy left at 3.30pm Andy having developed a sneezing cold. Weather cool
and windy.

Left Monday midnight to catch the ferry from Newhaven to Dieppe leaving Susie
with us – settled admirably.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
July 8th
</h4>

<p>
Left Bourton just after 4am and in Ilkley by 8 o’clock. Visited estate agents
later in day and on Thursday and Friday saw several houses. What with journey
and looking felt exhausted.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
July 12th
</h4>

<p>
Went to inspect the bungalow which we had previously not considered as it was on
the Skipton Rd.
</p>

<p>
As soon as we went in both of us felt that was the place for us, easy to live
in, easy to maintain, yet in spite of its position on a busy road an air of
spaciousness around it and possibly we’d be just as interested in the fast
moving cars of Skipton Rd as the slow moving cows of Gorse Meadow and a flat
walk to town centre.
</p>

<p>
The other houses we had seen since we had come up on Wednesday had reduced us to
despair, too high, too low, too crowded in, to big etc.
</p>

<p>
As the bungalow had just come on the market decided not to bargain. Could not
face further delays and uncertainties. The lower rateable value aided our
choice, £130+ less than other houses we had seen.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
July 14th
</h4>

<p>
Bought 39 Skipton Rd, bungalow. Paid the asking price £48,750 to include
carpets and curtains wall lights etc.
</p>

<p>
Emotionally and physically exhausted with house searching. What a relief!
</p>

<h4 class="main">

</h4>

<p>
At Ilkley since the 8th July, Helen, Robin and Ian in France. Marjorie very much
against Mayfield and with me uneasy decided to look again.
</p>

<p>
A pigeon – whilst Jane and Andy were with us at Bourton we were sitting on the
seat on the patio waiting for Laba’s meat and two veg. My friend the pigeon
with whom I had shared many a young plant, not always too willingly on my part,
came strutting about the patio ignoring us. Fascinated by the lounge glass doors
it stood on the step and peered and pecked. Left and returned several times.
Intrigued, I opened the sliding door, it immediately made for the opening,
boldly entered the lounge, walked around, inspected it, calmly walked out and
then flew off, saying thank you as it rose in the air. I have not seen it since.
</p>

<h4 class="main">

</h4>

<p>
Phoned Mr Forrest, removal man. A lovely Yorkshire voice answered the phone.
“We’ll look after you” was his concluding remark.
</p>

<p>
Went to his office, which is his house, shown into his sitting room by Mr F, a
roly poly Pickwickian gentleman. Showed warm interest in our problems and
virtually reassured us that we would live happily ever after. Then handed us
over to his son, a man of lean and hungry look who said that he would “cost”
it and let us have the estimate tomorrow. Very interested in his account of the
Forrest family. They have all lived in Wellington Rd since the days of his great
grandfather. Any removal they have done for themselves has been from one house
in Wellington Rd to another in the same street. I suggested the street should be
called Forrest Road.
</p>

<p>
I have been taking Susy for a walk every day without the lead. She does so enjoy
it and I am training her to stop barking especially at the start of the walk
with some success.
</p>

<p>
Keeping to the pavement, waiting at the curb, all so far without incident.
</p>

<p>
Last Sunday Susy was 20 yds. Ahead of me and about to pass the house for the
elderly when a vicious, frightening barking arose and out of the driveway
bounded at speed a red setter (I think). Susy flattened herself, the setter was
going so fast it seemed to go over the top of Susy and was now within a few yds
of me. I was frightened. Susy with her most belligerent bark made for the setter
attacking her from the rear, snapped at her hind legs and put her to flight
following her into the house drive. I called her off and we resumed our walk,
both very pleased with Susy’s famous victory.
</p>

<p>
Jane rang up and said she and Andy would be coming on Friday and would want fish
and chips.

Still feeling very tired and sleeping a lot. Enjoyed a trip in the car with

Whortleberries (Devon) Winberries (Wales) Bilberries (North). Mum not well and
had to sit in the shade of the rocks whilst Helen and Maureen wandered off to
pick the berries – very unsuccessful they returned after about an hour with
enough berries to cover the bottom of a mug.

Ian gave a film show in the evening showing photos taken whilst on their French
holiday. Must have taken between 50 and 100. Could not help being struck by the
absence of people in France. Especially emphasised by the photo of the spa
section of Vichy, empty chairs and lonely taps of Vichy Water. I felt sad, as if
one of the modern bombs which destroys people and not property had been a recent
visitor.

Moved in to Springfield, 39 Skipton Rd Ilkley. Felt at home straight away. Our
furniture looks better here than it did in Bourton.

Helen especially, immensely helpful.
