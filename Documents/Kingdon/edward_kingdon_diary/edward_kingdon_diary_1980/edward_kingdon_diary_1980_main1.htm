March 3rd
</h4>

<p>
Noticed last entry was Oct. 1978. Have never kept a diary. Must try. 
<i>[He had actually started another diary on 21st December 1978.]</i>
</p>

<p>
Helen’s birthday – a sunny day and Mum and I drank her health and reminisced, 
seated on the patio in warm sunshine.
</p>

<p>
Put in onion sets and half row of onion seeds.
</p>

<p>
Helen and Robin have bought a new Vauxhall Chevette.
</p>

<h4 class=main>
March 8th
</h4>

<p>
Letter from Jane. Upset to read that she had been robbed in Paris of £80. 
Judging from the tone of the letter did not allow it to completely spoil her 
week-end. She is very resilient.
</p>

<h4 class=main>
March 10th
</h4>

<p>
Am summoned to the aid of Mrs Clifford, aged 84, Audrey Sterry’s mother. 
A blackbird had come down the chimney. 
Easily caught it in my two hands and set it free. 
Returned home two hours later completely exhausted, having been kept standing 
whilst listening to a monologue from this tough old lady. 
Two hours standing and one hour 59 minutes talking and still as bright as a button. 
Maiden name Taylor, supervisor in a munitions factory in 1914 – 18 war and nick 
named Purity by the girls she supervised. 
Purity Taylor will be our name for her from now on.
</p>

<p>
Slowly recovering aided by a stiff whisky when Ricky and Phil called. 
Took us out for a drink – the merry brother bachelor 58, married divorcee 43 and 
very successful marriage. 
Invited to Chipping Sodbury to see film he took of Mr Sawyer and me at the Toll Gate, 
Chadwell Heath in early 1960’s.
</p>

<h4 class=main>
March 15th
</h4>

<p>
Finished Trollope’s <i>Barchester Towers</i>. Enjoyed it immensely. 
Can not remember even a mention of him when I was a schoolboy. 
Am convinced I would not have appreciated him when younger. 
Compensations in being a late developer.
</p>

<h4 class=main>
March 24th
</h4>

<p>
Cheltenham to buy a cable clip for car heater. None in stock. Next week perhaps?
</p>

<h4 class=main>
March 26th
</h4>

<p>
Almost unbearable pain in both upper arms and neck, lasted minutes.
</p>

<h4 class=main>
March 31st
</h4>

<p>
Since 26th have been resting. Bed every afternoon. 
Slight twinges but chest still feels raw and sore.
</p>

<p>
Since Helen’s birthday a cold, wet dull month. 
Have sown a row of peas and broad beans early March. 
Barely half the Autumn sown beans have survived the winter and then two 
very hard frosts on successive nights have decimated the remainder.
</p>

<p>
Put some runner beans in pots in the cold frame.
</p>

<p>
First daffodils appeared on March 10th in the shelter of a lavender bush. 
But the rest of the daffodils still to flower.
</p>

<p>
Mum had good news on 21st. doctor checked blood pressure and it has now 
returned to normal but continue with the pills- moduretic.
</p>

<p>
On 28th a letter from Joy and Albert. 
Glad to hear that Jane had written to them, in reply to birthday present I assume. 
Joy’s words “ a lovely letter, talent for writing an interesting letter, we 
were very pleased”.

April 1st
</h4>

<p>
Milder but no sunshine. This quote from Trollope’s <i>Dr Thorne</i> p.625 puts
paid to my belief that Springs were better when I was young. Written in 1858:-
</p>

<blockquote>
  “The comic almanacs give us dreadful pictures of January and February: but,
  in truth the months which should be made to look gloomy in England are March
  and April. Let no man boast himself that he has got through the perils of
  winter till at least the seventh of May”.
</blockquote>

<p>
Birthday letter to Violet enclosing £5 premium Bond.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 4th
</h4>

<p>
Severe frosts last two nights but sun during day.
</p>

<p>
Last night watched a very interesting programme on dyslexia; the probable reason
for my 

<a
href="../../../../Smith/smith_3rd_elizabeth_ann_smith/smith_3rd_elizabeth_smith_frame.htm"
title="Elizabeth Ann Smith's Entry">
 mother’s</a> inability to read or write. Made several attempts to teach her
when I was between the ages of 12 and 15, but she seemed to be unable to
recognise the letters even, the lesson usually ending in tears, distressing for
both of us.
</p>

<p>
My mother never spoke of her early days and I never asked any questions. That
she had had small pox, was a delicate child, that her 

<a

that she had two sisters

 Jack</a> who was drowned at sea is about the total
of my factual knowledge. Jack’s photo in what I assume to be a midshipman’s
uniform and looking very young was always on display in our sitting room, in
which we rarely sat. I assume it was because her brother was called Jack that
she always called me so, although I was christened John. I was curious about
this when young but never asked why.
</p>

<p>
My Grandfather died before I was born, name Smith, small in stature.
Recollection of my 

<a
href="../../../../Smith/smith_2nd_elizabeth_smith/smith_2nd_elizabeth_smith_frame.htm"
title="Elizabeth Smith's Entry">
Grandmother</a>, tall and angular with a strong personality. She
died when I was about 9 or 10. My mother and I went down from Newton Abbot to
Helston for the funeral. The funeral was over when we got to Auntie Katie’s
house where the returning mourners had assembled. My mother cried and I said in
a loud voice “It is no use crying over spilt milk”. The embarrassed silence
and the queer looks the assembled adults gave me was overwhelming and I fled to
the shelter of the privy in the courtyard.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 6th
</h4>

<p>
Easter Sunday. Helen, Robin and Ian arrived in their new car – a Vauxhall
Chevette. All well except that Helen was recovering from two severe colds in
succession.
</p>

<p>
Ian, 5 ft. 9 ½ in., cut the grass and prepared the stakes for the runner beans
– very helpful. Wish Jane had been here as well but obviously Andy has
priority. They are hoping to come before the end of March. <i>[April?.]</i>
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 7th
</h4>

<p>
Ian is keen on photography. Spent several hours in the village on his own taking
photographs.
</p>

<p>
Had a wonderful evening. Helen and I stayed up till 3 am. Felt very close to
her. I’ll treasure those hours together.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 8th
</h4>

<p>
Robin took us all into Cheltenham. Enjoy being chauffeur driven. Mum and I did a
bit of food shopping whilst Helen, Robin and Ian dashed around doing theirs.
Helen bought a pair of sandals to walk in the footsteps of Sir Walter Scott in
July. Met in the Star for a drink.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 9th
</h4>

<p>
Helen, Robin and Ian returned to Ilkley, taking my golf clubs and the hickory
shafted ones of 

<a href="../../../../Tate/tate_3rd_david_tate/tate_3rd_david_tate_frame.htm"
title="David Tate's Entry">
 David Tate</a> given to me when I started to play golf at Hainault
in 1931. Felt sad. Feel that I will never play again, although I really finished
playing golf in 1939 when my handicap was 11. The odd rounds played since I’ve
thoroughly enjoyed, even though I played badly.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 14th
</h4>

<p>
Dry, fine and sunny for a fortnight but twelve night frosts. Beans sown in Feb.
showing but no peas.
</p>

<p>
Sowed spinach, leeks and carrots. Brussel seeds through, but disappointing, the
birds having used the bed as a dust bath.
</p>

<p>
Wrote a letter to Joy and Albert.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 15th
</h4>

<p>
Went to Cheltenham and collected heater cable clip from Bristol Street Motors. A
warm day. After shopping in Sainsbury’s Mum alarmed me by showing signs of
collapse. Got the car and returned home immediately. Mum soon recovered but
confidence affected.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 16th
</h4>

<p>
Received letter from Violet.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 17th
</h4>

<p>
Delighted to hear Jane’s excited voice on phone. Had passed her driving test
at the first attempt. We felt as thrilled as she was. Toasted her success. Also
said she had a pay rise of £7 a week and Andy promoted and will be based in the
Manchester Area.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 19th
</h4>

<p>
Shifted several barrow loads of “muck” from the compost heap. Hope it will
do the garden more good than it did me. Sowed parsnips.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 20th
</h4>

<p>
Feeling better. No harm done. Still no rain but cloudy and bitter wind from the
North.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 22nd
</h4>

<p>
First rain of the month – very light shower.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 25th

<p>
Letter from Jane, coming to see us on May 2nd.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 26th
</h4>

<p>
Cheltenham with Mr and Mrs Moore.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 27th
</h4>

<p>
Marjorie heard first cuckoo?
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 28th
</h4>

<p>
Planted pea plants given to me by Matt Greenwood. Sowed lettuce and Savoys
(January King).
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 29th
</h4>

<p>
Jane phoned from office postponing visit until the 9th May. Helen and Robin have
had a week-end break in the Lake District.
</p>

<p>
The Moores spent evening with us. Had just received news that their daughter
Jennifer, aged 40, had married a New Zealander. Parents on each side not told
until after the event. Moores pleased as Jennifer had been treated for manic
depression. Will ‘a pair of trousers’ cure that? They are hoping so.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
April 30th
</h4>

<p>
A dry month, no measurable rain and finishing with cold north-east winds. Even
the broad beans refuse to grow.
</p>

<p>
All my early sown onion sets have turned soft, had to plant another lot.
</p>

<p>
The buying of second hand books has revived my interest in reading. Have
acquired what is for me a new method of reading, several books ‘on the go’
at the same time. At the moment Trollope’s <i>Dr Thorne</i>, Scott’s <i>Peveril
of the Peak</i>, Maeterlinck’s <i>Wisdom and Destiny </i>and <i>The White
Cross and Dove of Pearls </i>by an anonymous Victorian author. I read for the
flavours of the period – Victorian – rather than for the story. I put down <i>Wisdom
and Destiny </i>having just read:-
</p>

<blockquote>
  “The true sage is not he who sees, but he who, seeing the furthest, has the
  deepest love for mankind. He who sees without loving is only straining his
  eyes in the darkness”
</blockquote>

<p>
And I pick up <i>The White Cross etc </i>and read this astounding opening
paragraph:-
</p>

<blockquote>
  “A Sabbath on the Wolds of Yorkshire, where the rest seems eternal and the
  valley sleeps within the slumberous hills which encircle it like enfolding
  arms, while on their moory brow, tawny and princely as the brow of an Eastern
  monarch, glows the golden crown of the bridegroom of the heavens, who leaves
  it for a moment while he draws his crimson curtains around him.”
</blockquote>

<p>
What delightful effluence [sic] verbal intoxication. My apologies to the young
lady for the first word used.
</p>

<p>
And then Trollope refers to buying “a penny label to affix to a letter”.
</p>

<p>
And Scott describes Meg Merrilees as "randy", the adjective obviously having
a very different meaning from the modern one.
</p>

<p>
August Courtauld in 1931 spent five months alone on the Greenland Ice Cap, the
months being those of the Arctic Winter. The tent had a copy of Scott’s book <i>Guy
Mannering </i>and in his diary Courtauld wrote:-
</p>
<blockquote>
  “Scott’s description of food in V V G”
</blockquote>

<p>
That is how I read books now.

<p>
Jane arrived on the 9th. Met her at Cheltenham Station. Train punctual 9.15.
Looked very pretty, hair style longer, framed her face.
</p>

<p>
Had my first experience of being driven by my granddaughter. Hope she did not
feel my unease. No need for it. Drove like a veteran – felt quite relaxed by
the time we reached Bourton. Am very pleased for her. Whatever that girl sets
her mind on she can do it.
</p>

<p>
Drove us to Cheltenham and back on the Saturday. Bought a bed cover for Jane’s
bottom drawer from Johnny the Junk - £9-50. We are all pleased with it –
cotton, excellent quality, might be pre 1914.
</p>

<p>
Jane chauffered us home. Handles car well and has a good road sense. Am very
impressed.
</p>

<p>
Jane spoke of her marriage to Andy as likely to take place in May 1981.
</p>

<p>
Andy arrived Sat. evening having driven his mother to Godalming from Ilkley.
Talked of his job and prospects – obviously has ambition to do well. Easy
manner – adjusts to company – should stand him in good stead as a salesman.
</p>

<p>
Had the pleasure of giving Jane a diary of her which I started in 1960 Feb. Very
much regret not having kept it up. Last entry Xmas 1961 by Helen. I wonder if
she also will regret not having written more. Had not read it since we left
Chadwell Heath in 1965. Note that it records my first and only poem. Am not
ashamed of it on re-reading.

Our neighbour Joan Summers has decided to move near her daughter Marion at
Walton-on-Thames. Had a valuer to price the house – fee £57 – suggested £48,000

 Jack</a> to Morton to catch the mid day London train. During visit had very
little to say either personal or impersonal and was extremely angry with
Marjorie for asking questions. We could get no picture at all of his life at
Hampstead. Wanted the television on all the time.

<p>
Joan came in today with the strange request that we compile a list of things we
would like to buy when she moves. Phoned Helen and Jane – Jane said
“Everything, provided it’s a bargain”.

<p>
No luck with the furniture bargains, Joan asking far too much.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
15th – 22nd June
</h4>

<p>
Tried a new route for me to Ilkley via Coventry, M59 and M1 to Leeds. Clocked
177 miles, approx. 30 miles less than the M5, M6 route. Return journey same
route, clocked 180 miles.
</p>

<p>
Felt very tired the whole week I was there but enjoyed being with the family.
</p>

<p>
Helen still busy with outside work, but has given in her library notice.
</p>

<p>
Visited her at the library with Ian, also visited with her a very rural hamlet,
name ?, and was very interested in the small rural church – very unusual.
Reminded me of a similar ancient church in Cornwall, now on the edge of the sand
and in danger of erosion. Had lunch in a pub at ?. Very rare for Mum and I to
lunch out. Especially enjoyed it because Helen was with us.
</p>

<p>
Ian still growing, about 5ft. 10in. and not yet 15, is conscientious with school
work. Seems to have a bent for the Sciences but admits to being no linguist.
</p>

<p>
Went to Leeds by train from Ben Rhydding. I like the branch line journey,
reminds me of my youth, when my 

<a
href="../../../../Smith/smith_3rd_elizabeth_ann_smith/smith_3rd_elizabeth_smith_frame.htm"
title="Elizabeth Ann Smith's Entry">
 mother</a> and I used to get off the main line train
to Penzance at Gwinear Road and take the branch line train to Helston to see her

<a
href="../../../../Smith/smith_2nd_elizabeth_smith/smith_2nd_elizabeth_smith_frame.htm"

mother</a> and sisters

href="../../../../Smith/smith_3rd_harriet_katey_smith/smith_3rd_harriet_katey_smith_frame.htm"
title="Harriet Katey Smith's Entry">
 Katie</a> and my cousins Violet, Olive and Norman.
Norman later became the driver on that branch line which was so rural that
Norman allowed me to travel on the ‘foot plate’ i.e. the engine, something I
never did with my father as it was strictly forbidden – penalty instant
dismissal. The line is alas no more and Helston has no railway station. Our
journey cost us nothing as my father was allowed 2 free passes a year for
himself and family. He never used his until the twenties because there were no
paid holidays.
</p>

<p>
Met Jane in the Queens Hotel, Leeds and went mad, lunching out for the second
time in a week. Again enjoyed it, this time because Jane was with us. Jane went
back to work and we had a little nap in the hotel lounge, then made our
tortoise-like way to Emsley, Collins’s offices in Park Row. Glad to have seen
Jane in her office, both attractive. Unfortunately Jane was busy so our stay was
brief.
</p>

<p>
Helen and Robin have redecorated hall, stairs and landing, new stair carpet to
be laid so Robin took up old carpet, making sure that the surface was smooth and
free from nails. Had my sympathy as a do-it-yourselfer man, when water pipes
were accidently pierced.
</p>

<p>
Helen and Robin asked us to consider coming to live up there. Readily agreed but
altered our decision on coming back to Bourton.

very tired, we sat by the fire and toasted ourselves – whisky for me and
brandy for Mum.

Stanley Clifford (80) unable to come as had returned from Switzerland ill,
Marjorie Moore (65), Kenneth Moore (64), Joy and Matt Greenwood (60?) and Bob

<p>
Asking price of house £18,500.

Unusual gathering of swallows. Very agitated. My theory – a shortage of food
owing to the cold weather and wondering whether to fly off early to Africa.

A mole on the patio. Have not seen one since I was a boy. It was morning, sun
shining and watched it for some time as it had taken refuge under the table.
Must have been a young one.

Week-ending 14th Sept.

all. Jane’s description of her holiday in Minorca full of joie-de-vivre.
</p>

give it but feel uneasy at her giving up her job as employment prospects are not
good now.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Oct 14th
</h4>

<p>
Picked the last of the runner beans. Went into Cheltenham on my own. Bought 4
photograph albums for Ian at 99p each, an excellent bargain. Had a very
enjoyable hour with Johnny the Junk, trade bad. Bought a combined tea and dinner
set 52 pieces Bavarian circa 1900. Johnny knocked off £5 so got it for £40.
Present for Helen or Jane, whoever wants it most.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
19th Oct

<p>
First of the Savoys for dinner – very good. Helen phoned – visit postponed

</p>

<h4 class="main">
21st Oct
</h4>

<p>
Went to Longborough to get more Cox’s. All gone.
</p>

<p>
PM Joan Padget called. Brother’s carpet firm founded by her father gone into

million. Joan invited us to Hereford to spend the night, enabling us to call at
Hay-on-Wye to see the 2nd hand book shops.
</p>

<p>
Frank Cliffords small engineering firm specialising in aeroplane parts –
prospering. Could expand but unable to get skilled men.

<p>
Helen phoned. Would like the Bavarian Dinner and Tea set. Coming down early in
Nov.

Put up book shelves in east bedroom. Took 3 days, as usual making do with bits
of wood acquired over the years. Possibly part of Kenneth’s wardrobe.
</p>

<p>
Bought among other books <i>Vie de Jeanne D’Arc </i>par Anatole France, in two
volumes for £1. Published 1905.
</p>

<p>
Intend to read at least one page a day. Am reminded of Harold Toms who on our
last meeting, he was 76, said that he had just finished reading Hardy’s <i>Tess
of the D </i>in Russian. He died shortly afterwards on a plane to Bulgaria where
he was meeting his Communist Esperanto friends.

<p>
Jane enters a new phase of life with Andy in their “nest” at 2 Northridge
Rd, Pensby, The Wirral. When I asked if I should address the letters ‘Mr.
&amp; Mrs.’, Jane said “That’s daft”. Not a bit like the Victorian
heroines I have been reading about.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Nov 6th

<p>
On the phone – Robin says they will have to postpone coming down. Flat roof
leaking water.
</p>

<p>
Jane sounded pleased with house and progress in buying. Had just bought a three
piece suite. Busy decorating house before furniture cluttered it. Sleeping on
floor in lounge.
</p>

<h4 class="main">

<p>
Snow, first time we have had snow before Xmas since we have been in Bourton.
Oct. was cold but mainly dry with rationed sunshine but Nov. has so far been
very cold.
</p>

<p>
Garden has been “put to bed” for the winter. Am pleased with my efforts,
most of vegetable plot dug ready for next year’s sowings.

<p>
Have been visiting Ann Drew weekly in the Cottage Hospital.

Voyager 1 reached Saturn.

Letter from Helen giving full description of visit to Jane. Very impressed with
house etc.

Letter from Ian hoping to be golf member.

<p>
Very cold slight snowfall.
</p>

<p>
Saw television play in which an old fashioned slate was being used. Revived very
vivid memories of infants’ school days at Decoy, Newton Abbot. Slates and
slate pencils were the basic materials for the teaching of writing. I can feel
the squeaks of the pencils now. The slates were of 3 different kinds, those with
the letters of the alphabet and lined, those with sentences e.g. “Waste not,
want not” and plain ones. We graduated from the first to the third according
to our proficiency. The writing was copper plate, thin up strokes and thick down
strokes. A natural left-hander I have no recollection of being forced to write
right handed. I suspect I was skilfully encouraged for which I salute Miss
Hockaday and Miss Warcham. I can remember changing hands when my right got tired
but I never mastered the “copper plate”. I know this because the best pupils
had a brand new slate occasionally – a lovely black virgin surface – but my
slates were always dirty grey and a light grey at that. It grieved me. Morning
school started with a hands and head inspection – cleanliness – and then we
had to show our rags which for most of us served a double purpose – slate and
nose wiper. The rag had to be slightly damp. As it dried out it was topped up
with spit. The slate was used for English, Arithmetic and Drawing – the latter
a prized lesson on Friday afternoons when coloured chalks were issued. It seems
so vivid I’m inhaling the chalk dust now.

Letter from Jane giving detailed account of new home and furniture bargains, two
wardrobes and a dressing table for £50, and a dining room suite – sideboard,
table and 4 chairs in solid teak for £150.
</p>

<p>
Learned that Helen and Robin would be taking us there on the 20th.

Anne out of hospital but legs still causing trouble. Visited her at home. Felt
cold there, not enough heat for me but she did not seem to mind.

<p>
Oil boiler broke down.

Dec 9th

<p>
Mr Dark called. Serviced and repaired it for a fee of £10 which I thought very
reasonable.
</p>

<p>
The Hanby’s called and we had an enjoyable Christmas drink. Dolly is an
authority on human diseases, this time a new one – “frozen shoulder”.
Seemed to me that it balanced very well against “scalding water”.
</p>

<p>
Wally told some good tales of his father, a Durham miner, the strongest man he
had ever known.
</p>

<p>
“Had a lovely death” said Wally “at 89. Sitting in a chair, bent down to
pick up his glass of whisky and died”.
</p>

<p>
“Smoked a clay pipe until the day he died. When not in mouth, pipe was stuffed
in his waistcoat pocket. Occasionally, especially when gardening, would stoop
and pipe snapped. Do you know what he used to do?” says Wally dramatically
“Take a pen knife, make a nick in his arm, dip the ends in the blood. Tough
old bugger he was” concludes Wally admiringly.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Dec 14th
</h4>

<p>
Set off from Bourton at 11 am, Helen driving. Stopped at Service Station in
Nottingham area. Robin took over, reached Ilkley at 2.45 pm. Rain at first but
finished the journey in sunshine to be greeted by Ian, preparing himself a
massive meal of omelette, sausages, bacon and mushrooms! Checked his height –
5ft. 10 in. in his stocking feet. The first time we have come to Ilkley without
Jane being present – missed her.
</p>

<p>
Impressed with the new look house – curtains, stair, hall and landing carpets,
pictures – re arrangement of furniture – very good. One of the photos Ian
has taken on the landing wall – very effective.
</p>

<p>
Helen, Robin and Ian went to Film Society at the Craiglands. Had only just gone
when Jane phoned from Pensby. Very glad to hear her voice. She asked if we had
missed her. Sounded full of joie- de vivre; the 3 piece suite had arrived, £740,
- up to expectations – smashing! Insisted that she was going to cook a meal
for us when we arrived on Sunday.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Dec 15th
</h4>

<p>
Marjorie and I walked down to Ilkley facing a very strong, cold wind all the
way. Marjorie felt ill, glad to get into Betty’s Café – pot of tea for her,
coffee for me. Revived, talked to a German Jewess, refugee from Hitler in the
30’s, fiancé killed in a German concentration camp. Co incidence – 89 year
old German Jewess refugee – customer in the Listers. Has Yorkshire a German
Jewish Colony? Textiles?
</p>

<p>
Visited the shops. Should we buy a ham for Helen? Drink in the Listers then
phoned Helen – first wrong number, then forgot to press the button. Helen
guessed and was chasing around Ilkley trying to find us. Found us outside
Hillards. Felt guilty at causing her all that trouble. She looked tired. Her
teaching term does not finish until end of week. Bought ham about £10. Glad to
be driven home.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Dec 16th
</h4>

<p>
Marjorie and I walked down to Ilkley, much better morning and we enjoyed it.
Coffee in Betty’s, then a tour of the shops, finally the Listers sun lounge,
the sun streaming through the windows. Helen joined us at 1.30 pm after her
morning session at College. Still looked tired, think she was glad to sip a
whisky. Took Marjorie home by car. I stayed to go to one of my favourite haunts
Dr Riley’s Book Shop in Skipton Rd. nobody there i.e. no customers so sat
talking to a youngish looking grandmother who was minding the shop. Bought two
books, one by Silas Hocking published in the 90’s. Have read the first
chapter, an echo of the later stories in <i>The Magnet </i>of which I was an
avid reader.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Magnet</i>, <i>Gem</i>, <i>Penny Popular </i>were the main children’s
weekly publications, full scale stories, not comics. <i>The Magnet </i>was
delivered to our house every week from about 1913 – 20 and all copies were
carefully kept in the cupboard under the stairs. The boys of Greyfriars School
opened up a new world to me, my hero being Bob Cherry, closely followed by Harry
Wharton. To me Billy Bunter was quite a minor character.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
17th Dec
</h4>

<p>
Went to Ilkley on my own, Marjorie wanted to rest. Routine as usual but added my
last port of call – the Craiglands. Ordered a bowl of Hyacinths for Peggy £3-45.
Helen very tired, slept all the evening.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
18th Dec
</h4>

<p>
Planned to lunch with Helen at Harry Ramsden’s Fish and Chip Restaurant.
Arrived to find a queue. Bitterly cold wind and a slight fall of snow, so bought
some fish and chips and ate them at home. Spent the rest of the day by the
fireside.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
19th Dec
</h4>

<p>
Ian and Helen finished school. My day spent between Ben Rhydding and Ilkley,
resting in Betty’s, the Listers and the Craiglands. Bought Hyacinths for Jane.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
21st Dec
</h4>

<p>
The day to which we had been looking forward very much – our visit to Jane.
Ian unable to come as Jane would be returning with us.
</p>

<p>
Left about 9.45 am, Helen driving and arrived at Pensby about mid-day. Warm
welcome from Jane and Andy. Liked the house very much, had a good bargain at £18,250.
V G brick built workshop – shed in the back. I’d have liked that. Luxurious
new lounge suite in delicate blue – I wonder how it will stand up to ‘wear
and tear’? Good bargain in teak dining suite £150 and bedroom wardrobes (2)
and dressing table for £50. To me the house seemed luxuriously furnished for a
young couple – and fully carpeted. Area very reminiscent of Elm Way, Ewell
which I had always liked.
</p>

<p>
All went out for a drink at the Old Quay Pub, Parkgate. Got an impression of the
Dee Estuary, hope to see more of it in the future.
</p>

<p>
Returned to an excellent dinner prepared by Jane, chicken followed by apple
crumble – a very efficient suburban housewife and Andy is an excellent host.
</p>

<p>
Felt grateful that I had lived to see Jane in her first “nest”.
</p>

<p>
Andy was going down to Godalming to spend Christmas with his mother so Jane
returned with us, Robin driving and we got home about 8 pm. We all enjoyed a
thoroughly good day.
</p>

<p>
Within minutes of getting in Jane was on the phone and within half- an-hour was
out meeting her ‘Ilkley tribe’.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
22nd Dec
</h4>

<p>
Helen starts her holiday pre Christmas preparations which she does without fuss,
apparently taking it all in her stride. She is a good organiser and a good cook
but I wonder if sometimes she does not think “I wish someone else was doing it
for a change”.
</p>

<p>
Played chess with Jane and Ian in the evening. Enjoyed it. I wish they would
play with me a bit more often.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
23rd Dec

<p>
Helen had a ‘do’ at the library. Joined us in the Lister’s at 2 pm. Took
Marjorie back home but I went along to the book shop. Books bought so far

<p>
Saw documentary film on tele – The Irish Famine 1845-49. Felt very disturbed
and sad.
</p>

<p>
Jane came in about 10.45 pm, relieved the gloom, closely followed by Ian who had
been to a party at Burleigh [sic], having played squash in the afternoon. The
two are in complete contrast, Jane very rarely in and Ian very rarely out except
with his Mum and Dad.
</p>

<p>
We had a very arduous walk down to Ilkley in the morning, faced a very strong,
gale force wind all the way. Both of us exhausted when we reached Betty’s.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Dec 24th
</h4>

<p>
Helen and Robin did the final Christmas shopping. Marjorie too tired to walk
down to Ilkley. Jane accompanied me part of the way, off to join her friends at
the Tap. Went there after my session at the Lister’s. A very nice crowd of
youngsters. A quick drink with them and then the snails progress home via
Craiglands. Coming out of the Craiglands a car drew up. Jane had come to look
for her grandad – very touched.
</p>

<p>
Spent the whole of the evening playing chess with Ian. The best game he has
played against me. Jane out all evening with friends. Helen prepared turkey etc.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Dec 25th
</h4>

<p>
Joined by Peggy at 11 am for the Christmas Ceremony around the Xmas Tree which
we all enjoy every year. From Helen and Robin – the Christmas Plate, the 4th
one now.
</p>

<p>
From Jane – D Attenborough’s <i>Life on Earth</i>
</p>

<p>
From Ian – a framed photo taken by himself at Hidcote Manor Aug. 1980
</p>

<p>
From Peggy – a bottle of whisky for me, handkerchiefs and eau de cologne for
M.
</p>

<p>
Gave to Helen and Robin the Duke of Bavaria’s ? 52 piece dinner and tea set.
</p>

<p>
Gave to Jane 21 piece Doulton Tea Set Silver Birch design, sheets for 3 beds and
a Good Housekeeping Book.
</p>

<p>
Gave to Ian – 4 picture albums and £5
</p>

<p>
Gave to Peggy bowl of Hyacinths
</p>

<p>
Later joined by Grace, Lily and Elsie ‘Evergreen’ friends of Peggy. Sherry
for all, whisky for me.
</p>

<p>
Then Christmas Dinner. Helen has never had a failure with her Xmas dinner. We
all enjoyed it, clean plates to prove it – turkey, her own Xmas pud. And
Robin’s home-made dinner wine hock type, the best I’ve tasted, a varied
cheese board, Stilton for me and a small glass of port. I slept soundly all the
afternoon in the chair and woke up to be served with raspberry trifle –
delicious.
</p>

<p>
Would have liked to have played chess in the evening or indeed any other game
but Jane and Ian preferred television and Jane could not resist going out for an
hour to visit her friend Nicola.
</p>

<p>
Tried to read <i>Life on Earth </i>but could not concentrate with Tele on.
However what I did read emphasised the syntheticness of the television drama.
From my odd bits of viewing I gathered that a nit wit heroine was somehow in the
pilot seat of a fully laden air-liner which was out of control, and aggressive
imbeciles on the ground were attempting to tell the beautiful moron how to fly
the plane. What happened I do not know as I fell asleep – and so to bed.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Dec 26th
</h4>

<p>
Went to Alan and Brita’s in Leeds filled with cold turkey and ham. Arrived
about 4 pm to find masses of food awaiting us. Foolishly ate some and was
inanimate physically for the rest of the evening. Have never seen a more self
possessed, self contained and placid child than Kirsten 15 months. Watched her
fascinated. An intelligent awareness which belied her placidity – remarkable.
Would like to see her in 10 years time. Spoken to in English and German by Alan
and Brita. No television but plenty of conversation to which I added little –
enjoyed it all the more for that.
</p>

<p>
Jane had driven us down and drove us back. Car windscreen iced up when we came
out. Jane drove with the confidence of youth, carrying on an animated
conversation with Helen in the front seat. I was fully expecting her on straight
stretches of road to jump over the back seat and chat to Laba and Grandad.
Arrived home about eight. Who is for chess? I asked feebly but on went the
television.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
27th Dec
</h4>

<p>
Last day at Ilkley, determined to do my routine in spite of feeling still full
of food. Had brandy and port before going to bed and peanuts – how stupid.
</p>

<p>
A fine day, walk did me good, the haunts provide the rest and liquid
refreshment. Joined by Helen, Robin and Ian in the Listers. They went on to
Skipton and I to the bookshop where Dr Riley and I exchanged small bottles of
whisky and then sampled them and bought <i>Coaching Ways and Coaching Days.</i>
</p>

<p>
Found Andy had arrived when I got back having driven up from Godalming in well
under 5 hrs. He and Jane were soon busy washing, shaving, ironing and laundering
themselves for Adrian’s party. We had our own cinema show with Ian doing the
honours. The first part of the show was Ian’s own pictures taken this year –
his first photographic year. Interesting to see, judging from the photos, how
Ian takes after his Dad when younger in photographing things rather than people.
</p>

<p>
The second part – photos of the family during the years – very interesting
to see the children as they developed. Helen was concerned about some of her
when Ian was young. Ian paid her a lovely compliment – “you look lovely”
– and I could not agree more. Very enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
Would have liked to play chess then, alas Ian opted for Tele.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
28th Dec
</h4>

<p>
Left Ilkley at 10.45am, Robin driving. Sunshine all the way and the Leicester
Forest Service Station crowded as if it were a summer Bank Holiday. Helen then
drove and back home in Bourton at 2.45 pm.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
29th Dec
</h4>

<p>
Helen and Robin left for Ilkley at 11 am, another Christmas over and a very
enjoyable one it was.
</p>

<p>
Had a good look at the cards and letters which I find I enjoy more and more as
each Xmas comes around. Sad about Winnie (81 now) mentally disturbed and unable
to enjoy her two grandchildren Rebecca and Hannah, a photo of whom was sent by
Jennifer.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
30th Dec
</h4>

<p>
Bob Sterry called in. Spent part of Christmas Day at the Cottage Hospital
distributing gifts on behalf of the Rotarians.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
31st Dec
</h4>

<p>
Claire Clifford called in to thank us and brought some home cured ham. We gave
her a slice of Helen’s Christmas Cake which we all agreed was first class.
</p>

<p>
Did not stay up to welcome in the New Year.
