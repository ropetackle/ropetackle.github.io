<p>
Redecorated lounge. Did not mean to but earlier in the month had bought my best
bargain so far – an oak surround mirror £12-00 (this included a Bible and two
Church of England Prayer Books which Mum fancied). Mirror made by carpenter for
his own use. Good beautifully “turned” and back solidly made, able to be
unscrewed and mirror taken out without disturbing the more delicate work of the
front.
</p>

<p>
Mirror placed on mantel piece, showed up most of room, so decorative. Mum washed
down, I painted.

<p>
A cloudless sky from 9am to dusk. Picked the last of the runner beans – a
record? Saw a Red Admiral on patio at mid day.

First signs of broad beans sown 2 or 3 weeks ago. Geraniums still in full
flower, and a fair number of roses.

Dec 21st 1978 (Ilkley)
</h4>

<p>
In November I bought the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i> in a ‘junk’ shop in
Cheltenham.
</p>

<p>
I bought it mainly because on the inside of the cover was pasted a gift token of
the Primitive Methodist Church inscribed “Presented to Mr. [?] for regular
Attendance July 1910”. To me it was a bit of social history connected with my
early childhood and my father’s life as a young man.
</p>

<p>
In my 

<a
href="../../../../Kingdon/kingdon_3rd_james_kingdon/kingdon_3rd_james_kingdon_frame.htm"
target="_top" title="James Kingdon's Entry">
 father’s</a> words “I left school well before I was ten”. As his
birthday was in August it is safe to assume that he left at Easter 1882, the
start of the busy season on the farm.
</p>

<p>
His first wage was one penny (1d) <i>[ ½ p.]</i> a day, sixpence <i>[2 ½ p.]</i>
a week “for working from dawn to dusk” again his words.
</p>

<p>
Saturday was a short day as they finished at tea time and were paid their wages.
</p>

<p>
The following tale I heard many times, the last not long before he died, and as
he got older it was the distress of his mother which weighed with him most
heavily.
</p>

<p>
“I was paid with the other labourers at about 4 o’clock. I had been looking
forward all the week to it and was feeling proud to be able to take a whole
sixpence home to my mother – much needed money in a poor household.&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;On being paid, some of the labourers went to the village pub and persuaded me to
come in with them. They bought me a drink and before I really knew what was
happening my sixpence was gone. I had only the one drink – a pint of ale.&quot;
</p>

<p>
&quot;I left for home crying. My 

<a
href="../../../../Kingdon/kingdon_2nd_susanna_kingdon/kingdon_2nd_susanna_kingdon_frame.htm"
target="_top" title="Susanna Kingdon's Entry">
 mother</a> did not need telling what had happened and
cried herself bitterly, even more so when my 

<a
href="../../../../Kingdon/kingdon_2nd_john_ford/kingdon_2nd_john_ford_frame.htm"
target="_top" title="John Ford's Entry">
 stepfather</a> gave me the biggest
‘leathering’ I ever had in my life”.
</p>

<p>
He always ended with the words “I’ve never forgotten it”.
</p>

<p>
Leathering, thrashing (I wonder if derived from threshing), walloping seems to
be the main words used by the men of that time to describe domestic corporal
punishment; beating, caning, flogging seemed to be more judicial and in the case
of beating upper class.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Dec 24th
</h4>

<p>
Family gone out to a musical evening at Maureen’s. Feel a bit guilty. Just
started to write when in rushes Jane with newly acquired fiancé, Andy, deposits
an immense card from Andy on the Television set, parcels under the Xmas tree and
off again.
</p>

<p>
When I was 8 years old, the war had broken out, I got my first job, also at 1d <i>[½
p.]</i> a day but my day was only 1 hour 6-7am.
</p>

<p>
Earlier in the year I had broken my arm falling out of a tree, the arm had been
set badly and I was having difficulty in bending it and touching my shoulder
with the tips of my fingers. The cure was to swing a bag of sand, very boring.
Swinging milk churns much more exciting.
</p>

<p>
I loved the job. It involved going with the milkman on his round and I did the
big houses, the ones with long drives and a couple of manor houses, one of which
belonged to Colonel ? I’ve forgotten his name.
</p>

<p>
There were no milk bottles, the gentry’s milk being carried in small churns
with handles. There were gallon churns, half gallon and quart. <i>[A gallon was
8 pints or 4.54 litres, a quart 2 pints or 1.14 litres.]</i>. They were filled
in the dairy before we set off, each customer having his own churn. These small
churns were arranged around the sides of the cart, on self made shelves very
much like the shelves in a larder but with a wooden guarding rail to prevent
them falling off.
</p>

<p>
In the well of the cart, I believe it was an adapted large trap, stood the two
large churns, one containing the fresh milk and the other the skimmed. The
skimmed was I believe ¼ d (one farthing) a pint or it might have been a quart.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Dec 26th
</h4>

<p>
Christmas day over. Enjoyed it. Helen organises well, without fuss. Peggy with
us from present opening to late evening. Alan and Brita and Andy joined us at
tea time. Shall treasure the gifts from Helen and Robin – a beautiful special
edition Christmas plate Royal Doulton, a little girl gathering holly near a snow
covered country church – could be Helen or Jane at that age and from Jane and
Ian a very attractive collage picture by Joan Lamb ? I hope they will get equal
pleasure from them when we pass them on owing to ourselves being compelled to
pass on.
</p>

<p>
The reins passed from the horse between the churns and we milkmen stood on a
platform at the back of the trap holding the reins.
</p>

<p>
I liked doing this and it was quite safe for an eight year old to drive as the
old horse knew better than I did when to stop and start.
</p>

<p>
When the churns were in position, a wooden bench with two holes in was placed
over the churns and rested about 1/3 the way down. This secured the churns and
there was no danger of them moving about as we bumped over the rough roads.
</p>

<p>
The wooden bench with the two holes reminded me of the familiar lavatory seat at
the bottom of the garden. Most people only had a one hole seat, but some did
have a larger lav. with a two hole seat.
</p>

<p>
A bucket was under the hole to receive the contributions of people ‘in
extremis’ – and in my case you had to be ‘in extremis’ to pay a visit
especially when the bucket was full. I never had the pleasure of occupying one
seat with a companion using the other. I doubt whether a double seat was meant
for that. It was probably a reserve bucket for occasions when there was an
excessive flow of contributions.
</p>

<p>
However back to intake rather than output. The milk was still warm from the cow
and it was my job to run up the long drives carrying the correct churn which I
deposited at the back door if the empty churn was outside, if not I knocked and
it was usually a servant who answered.
</p>

<p>
She handed me the previous days churn, always scoured clean and they were also
done again when we got back to the dairy. Each churn had a tight fitting lid.
</p>

<p>
Jane and Ian’s picture from Village Green Country Crafts designed by Joan Lamb
?
</p>

<p>
Seen Andy several times, has natural courtesy and good manners. I like him. Jane
and he seem well suited. Very surprised and pleased – gave Marjorie a present
of oil (bath) and me a bottle of whisky.
</p>

<p>
Helen mentioned at dinner that she bought the Christmas Plate 1978 because the
picture on it reminded her of Jane.
</p>

<p>
The metal lid fitted snugly into the inside neck of the churn with an
overlapping flange which fitted equally snugly to the exterior neck of the
churn. Conditions were as ideal as it was possible to make them at that time for
the clean delivery of milk.
</p>

<p>
Cows milked outside dairy, buckets emptied into churns in dairy, churns sealed
and milk delivered untouched by hand.
</p>

<p>
It was different with the large churns as the lids had to be left off, allowing
the milk man to ladle out the pints and half pints in the jugs of the customers.
The roads, not macadamed but steam rollered stones could be very dusty in summer
and horse traffic added to the number of flies.
</p>

<p>
The perks were nearly all in kind – a piece of cake or tart, an apple, an
occasional boiled sweet or stick of liquorice.
</p>

<p>
This delightful job ended after twelve months because of a visit to our house of
the prospective parliamentary candidate for the Totnes division. We often put up
visiting Labour speakers for the night and this particular one was a Miss Kate
Spurrell an ardent member of the Independent Labour Party. This interfering busy
body persuaded my father that I was being exploited by the Capitalist Society
and in spite of my tears the Capitalist Society immediately lost an exploitee
and I did not commercially work again until I started teaching.
</p>

<p>
I started by reference to the Primitive Methodist Church. Leaving school at 9 my
father’s education was obviously limited and chances of getting any further
education whilst working as a farm labourer in a remote rural community were
also obviously limited.
</p>

<p>
Born in 1882 in

don’t know her Christian name). His mother married a farm labourer called Ford
and they produced a large family, about a dozen I believe not all of whom
reached maturity. I met four,

title="Bill Ford's Entry">
Bill</a>. Bill being exactly
the same age as myself and of course my uncle – a fact which caused me some
wonder when I was a child.
</p>

<p>
My father was always called by his mother’s name and I imagine he felt very
much the odd man out. Being the eldest and children coming rapidly one after the
other and poverty always with them, an early start to work was a necessity.
</p>

<p>
He never referred to his school days or Sunday School or his step brothers and
sisters as children or even any tales about work on the farm. Odd remarks about
crow scaring, milking cows, shifting muck, thinning and weeding turnips – back
breaking, winter gathering in of turnips to feed cattle – fingers agonisingly
cold. Never of ploughing or sowing or dealing with horses. I assume he had all
the monotonous unpleasant jobs, the start of learning to become a skilled farm
labourer.
</p>

<p>
He used to mention how tired and weary he used to be but no mention of doctors
or illness or social life and certainly there would be no books as there were
none in our house until later years and then very few.
</p>

<p>
At sixteen he went to Exeter to join the Great Western Railway as a cleaner. And
that is all I know – why he went, where he lived, what he felt like, did he
break with home? How long he was at Exeter I don’t know.
</p>

<p>
He must have been able to pass a test in reading, writing and arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
A cleaner was the lowest grade of footplate men – the men who manned the
engines.
</p>

<p>
The cleaner’s basic job was to clean the engines but it was really in those
days a long apprenticeship in the understanding of the steam locomotive, the
basic principles and an ability to service it and make running repairs when a
driver.
</p>

<p>
I always thought up to the age of 16 ? that he just stood in the cab and drove
the engine.
</p>

<p>
In 1922 ? he took me to the Wembley Exhibition, my first visit to London and at
that Exhibition or it might have been the Science Museum there was a locomotive
on show. He started to explain to me the principles of steam locomotion and
before we realised what was happening a crowd had gathered around us. At first I
was very embarrassed but my father was stimulated by the evident interest of the
crowd and continued to talk for a very long time, during which the crowd got
bigger and bigger and I lost my embarrassment and was old enough to realise for
the first time that he not only drove an engine but he had a real understanding
of the basic principles of steam engineering, hence the reason why he was a
member of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen and not a
member of the National Union of Railwaymen.
</p>

<p>
The ‘Associated’ as he called it, now called ASLEF, was a Craft Union and
although he did not want me to become a workman he was fiercely proud of his
union and equally contemptuous of the NUR especially of their leader ‘Jimmy
Thomas’.
</p>

<p>
I read that the Associated are still causing trouble even though the days of
steam have passed. It is partly due to their reluctance to renounce their craft
union status.
</p>

<p>
Raining heavily and Robin took us down to Ilkley, Jane was meeting Andy about
mid day. Marjorie and I went in the Lister’s Arms and I enjoyed three
Guinnesses and Marjorie one whisky. Jane joined us just as Robin came to pick us
up. Peggy and the family enjoyed cold turkey dinner.
</p>

<p>
Evening Helen, Robin, Ian and I played Mah Yong. All beginners, liked the game.
</p>

<p>
Jane breezed in – washed. Shaved, ironed and mangled and then off again with
‘her delightful pair of trousers’. Hey nonny nonny, hey nonny nonny. We live
through the young.
</p>

<p>
Regret Ian has not played his guitar today. I believe he is going swimming
tomorrow.

<h4 class="main">
Dec 28th
</h4>

<p>
Helen, Robin and Ian swimming at local baths. All enjoyed it.
</p>

<p>
It is Ian’s day today and this afternoon he is being taken to Bradford to see
Superman – the engaged couples Xmas treat for Ian.
</p>

<p>
Marjorie and I bought the first edition Christmas Plate £9-95. Should I live to
complete my 56 year gardening plan I hope to be able to collect a half century
of plates.
</p>

<p>
Marjorie bought a very attractive small jug and bowl.
</p>

<p>
Again raining all day – Robin again collected us from the Lister’s Arms
where I had had a very interesting chat with a member of the Yorkshire Cricket
Club about cricket in general and Yorkshire in particular.
</p>

<p>
Length of stay at Exeter unknown but was moved to Helston – date unknown. Went
to lodge at my 

<a
href="../../../../Smith/smith_3rd_elizabeth_ann_smith/smith_3rd_elizabeth_smith_frame.htm"
title="Elizabeth Ann Smith's Entry">
 mother</a>’s home, her family having fallen on hard times owing to
the death of her father and now were taking in lodgers.
</p>

<p>
My Aunt Janie’s (Olive’s mother) description of him “Shy, retiring,
blushed easily and wouldn’t say boo to a goose”.
</p>

<p>
My grandmother’s description of him “a foreigner”. To her anyone born east
of the River Tamar was a foreigner, in fact in her case she was so much a
Cornishwoman that anyone born east of Falmouth and west of the Tamar was not
really a true Cornishman.
</p>

<p>
Of his time spent in Helston I cannot remember him saying anything except
occasionally imitating the Cornish lilt of a question that he was probably often
asked “Going down town arree?”. When they were married or where I do not
know – either Helston of Plymouth.
</p>

<p>
From Helston he was moved to Plymouth and it was in the district of 

<a
href="../../../../Places%20&amp;%20Buildings/holdsworth_street/holdsworth_street_main.htm"
title="Picture Of The House In Pennycomequick" target="main">
Pennycumquick or Pennycomequick</a> that I was born on 22nd Sept. 1906. 
</p>

<p>
According to my mother his wages were 15/- one week <i>[75p]</i> and eighteen
shillings <i>[90p]</i> the following week if a full week was worked. As there
was no guaranteed week, at times it could be less. I take it that every second
week he worked on a Sunday, hence the extra 3/-<i> [15p]</i>.
</p>

<p>
And now we come to the Primitive Methodist Church.
</p>

<p>
The Revivalists Moody and Sankey had come to Plymouth – they had Wesley
fervour and Salvation Army gusto belting out such hymns as <i>‘Shall we gather
at the River, the beeootiful, beeootiful River’</i> and <i>‘Count your
blessings name them one by one’</i>.
</p>

<p>
I can dimly remember going to a Revivalist meeting at Exeter when I was about
five.
</p>

<p>
We had a Moody and Sankey hymn book in our house and it was still there when my
mother died in 1929.
</p>

<p>
My father went to one of their meetings and was converted. That is the only fact
I know about it.
</p>

<p>
Converted he now joined a church and that church was the Primitive Methodists,
strict and narrow in their views, exceeded only by the Plymouth Brethren.
</p>

<p>
Like the other Non Conformist Churches meetings were held on Sunday afternoons
for young men and women – Bible Classes. I believe the Congregationalists
called theirs Pleasant Sunday Afternoon.
</p>

<p>
The emphasis by the Non Conformists was on do it yourself and you had to be the
action giver, not the passive recipient. I am paraphrasing my father’s words
now.
</p>

<p>
Shy and diffident he not only had to read aloud in front of others but also join
in discussions on the subject matter read. The reading was entirely confined to
the Bible. He was also taught the discipline of reading as it was regarded as
compulsory to read one chapter of the Bible every day.
</p>

<p>
I don’t know whether it applied to other Bible Classes but in this particular
one the leader encouraged him to make a précis of what he had read.
</p>

<p>
There were also meetings in the week, Prayer Meetings where you had to get up
and pray aloud but only if the spirit moved, Band of Hope Meetings (Temperance),
singing evenings when he discovered that he had quite a good tenor voice and he
learned a bit about harmony and singing with baritones, basses etc. He enjoyed
it. I’ve just remembered another smashing hymn <i>“When the roll is called
up yonder I’ll be there”</i>. You heathens who read this will have no idea
how rousing this sounded when trebles, tenors, baritones and basses were in full
blast. It went like this:-
</p>

<blockquote>
  Trebles <i>&quot;When the roll&quot;</i><br />
  T B &amp; B <i>&quot;When the roll&quot;</i><br />
  All &amp; congregation <i>&quot;When the roll is called up yonder I’ll be
  there&quot;</i>.
</blockquote>

<p>
I wonder.
</p>

<p>
A single statement of his strangely sticks in my memory. “A doctor told me
always to read the leading article of a newspaper”.
</p>

<p>
In 1907 he was moved to Princetown, a promotion for him as he was now a
Fireman-Cleaner and was given a railway house on the edge of Dartmoor.
</p>

<p>
A little 

<a
href="../../../../Places%20&amp;%20Buildings/station_cottages/station_cottages_main.htm"
title="Photo Of The Cottages In Princetown" target="main">
terrace of cottages,</a> isolated from the village of Princetown. Figgins
the Station Master lived in one, Newsome the Driver, Kingdon the Fireman, French
the Ganger and ? the Guard lived in the others. 
</p>

<p>
There is a sequel to this. When Marjorie and I left Exmouth in 1966 we had our
one and only ‘posh’ holiday. We stayed in hotels not less than 3 star whilst
touring Cornwall and on the way back to Helen in Cricklade we stopped at
Princetown. The cottages were still there although the station had been shut
down.
</p>

<p>
I knocked at the door of the house I thought we used to live in, a flustered
elderly lady came to the door. I explained that I thought I used to live there
and my name was Kingdon and she immediately said “you’re Jim Kingdon’s
son”.
</p>

<p>
She was French’s daughter, her father dead and herself widowed and that very
day was moving to Plymouth to be near her daughter. In spite of still gathering
the bits and pieces together for the removal men, she insisted on us coming in
and made us a cup of tea.
</p>

<p>
We did not like to stay too long as she was obviously in a state of removal
confusion but the short visit was to me a very pleasing and unexpected link with
the past.
</p>

<p>
Ian has just come in having not only seen Superman at Bradford but also been
taken for a meal to Andy’s parents’ wine bar.
</p>

<p>
Omnivorous still for pictures, he wanted to watch television but both parents
put four feet down and disgruntled Ian after plucking the strings of a guitar
for a few minutes decided like Mr. Pepys that it was “and so to bed”.
</p>

<p>
I wish we lived nearer. I like this interplay of the generations.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Dec 29th
</h4>

<p>
The three generations went to the Lister’s to meet Andy and have a farewell
drink. Hoping to have a chat with him but conversation general and did not
gather a lot.
</p>

<p>
The four children Jane, Ian, Andy and I left the adults and adjourned to the
Pool Room. Very poor substitute for billiards and snooker.
</p>

<p>
Weather wise another poor day – cold with sleeting snow, glad of Robin’s
lift home.
</p>

<p>
My father said in later years that the four years spent at Princetown were among
the happiest in his life. The wage could not have been all that good as almost
immediately we took a lodger – Mr. Gilbart a headmaster of a small Dartmoor
village school (I believe it was Mary Tavy). He became not only my father’s
mentor but a very good friend until he died less than 41 years old.
</p>

<p>
Many years later when my father was retired and living at Bristol he showed me a
couple of letters he had kept from Mr. Gilbart. The letters were serious but
warm and friendly, the emphasis on religion and one of them a long account of
his struggles with his conscience re the Christian and War. He had decided to
become a Conscientious Objector which he did, 1914-18, and I believe, but am not
certain he spent some time in Princetown Prison.
</p>

<p>
I have only a very dim recollection of him, but I heard so much about him from
my parents that I have always thought I really knew him.
</p>

<p>
Due to go back to Bourton tomorrow. Weather forecast – snow spreading over the
whole country, icy roads, wind NE. Helen puzzling out how many grammes in an oz.
and how to make a lb. of wool do the work of two – making a jumper for Ian.
</p>

<p>
Jane gone out with Andy. Ian on floor drawing diagrams of aeroplanes. Marjorie
sewing buttons on a coat and Susie sleeping on the settee.
</p>

<p>
In the centre of the village opposite the Duchy Hotel was the village store, a
veritable village Selfridges selling everything. I can remember it as a child
and thought it was huge. It was owned by a man called Weeks who had several
daughters one of whom Mr. Gilbart married.
</p>

<p>
As far as I can gather the Wesleyan Methodist Church and the village stores were
the centre of the religious and social life of the village. The Weeks were warm,
generous people, great Methodists and they too befriended and helped my father
who was now a member of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. It was now, encouraged by
Gilbart and Weeks that he became a Lay Preacher of the Wesleyan Methodist
Church.
</p>

<p>
This meant that Sundays, not every Sunday, he would go off to a little chapel in
one of the isolated Dartmoor villages and ‘carry the Gospel’ sorry ‘Carry
the message of the Gospel’ based on the infallible book The Bible.
</p>

<p>
I do know that his real education was being broadened by Mr. Gilbart. Certain
simple phrases stick in my memory ‘we talked a lot’, ‘we studied
together’.
</p>

<p>
Since from his letters Gilbart was cultured and educated, probably a graduate,
one can make a guess at the topics – certainly Darwin, probably Trade Unionism
and Christianity, the Social System and Christianity, day to day politics. I do
know that my father started to broaden his mind, examine new ideas.
