<p>
I am still enjoying my Victorian literature and am formulating the theory that 
the ability to read and write was much more widespread among the ‘lower orders’ 
than is so often suggested.
</p>

<p>
I have a Volume on Tennyson compiled by his son, consisting mostly of letters 
written to and written by him.
</p>

<p>
One letter from a lady states that she has been to see an “old cottager” who 
was in service in his Aunt’s house when Tennyson was a youth, 
“and she still reads avidly everything she can about Master Alfred”.
</p>

<p>
Tennyson writes to a working man thanking him for the poems he has sent him and 
is pleased that he is getting so much solace and pleasure from his efforts.
</p>

<p>
He also writes to an old blacksmith in Sheffield in similar vein.
</p>

<p>
Tennyson was born in 1809 so it is fair to assume that these people were born 
too in the first quarter of the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p>
John Bright writes to the working men’s club (Rochdale) in mid Century. 
Again it is reasonable to suppose that there was more than one man able to read his letters.
</p>

<p>
Was the Victorian definition of literacy a classical education?
</p>

<p>
On television a play entitled <i> Blood and Bread</i> has a young shepherd reading the Bible. 
The play is supposed to be based on the tales of an old shepherd living in the 1820’s 
and 1830’s.
</p>

<p>
I have been asking people lately if they can remember learning to read and 
almost without exception the answer is basically no.
</p>

<p>
It seems to imply that the ability to read can be acquired almost as easily as 
the ability to speak and it seems unreasonable to assume that those with above average 
intelligence in the “lower orders” did not exercise every ingenuity to acquire this skill.
</p>

<p>
And what about those of us of average intelligence – the same in spite of no compulsory education?
</p>

<p>Which brings me to the below average who do find difficulty. 
In spite of the millions spent on education, there is a hidden minority who are illiterate. 
From my own experience I would suggest a minimum of ten percent, and that is not 
counting the subnormal and dyslexic.
</p>

<p>
Is there some quirk in their brain which cannot acquire the abstract, 
as I like to term it, for obviously to them letters seem to be a mysterious code 
which they find difficult to translate into concrete sounds.
</p>

<p>
Going back to my own experience I found only one answer – repetition. 
Speech was learnt by repetition, why not letters. 
Although frowned upon by modern educational theory it produced results as well as a 
sense of achievement. 
Learning through discovery gets nowhere with these unfortunates, they not only get 
left behind but they get lost – a tragedy.
</p>

<p>
Only one complete failure – Harry Keeble aged 11 who after one full week of 
chanting alone or with the class, singing it, shouting it, whispering it, dancing it, 
every conceivable way to give variety C-A-T, CAT failed to pass the test on 
Friday afternoon. 
I pointed to the letter C, Harry’s face beamed and in a loud voice he said “Ku for pussy”.
</p>

<p>
The blind leading the blind; if we could only understand, their apparent stupidity could be overcome. 
Anyway until we do repetition does achieve results.
</p>

<p>
The Victorian Era was a great age for “tracts”, free or at the most 1d, mainly religious and political. 
The tinkers carried tracts to villages and hamlets all over the country. 
There must have been a number of people to read them produced in such quantities. 
The Bible seems to be the one book at least that the ‘lower orders’ did acquire. 
The novelists do not stress the inability of servants etc to read but frequently 
mention them reading and writing notes and letters.
