Origin of the Kingdon Surname
</h3>


<p>
According to the Oxford Dictionary of Surnames the origin of the surname Kingdon is:-
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 100; margin-right: 20" >
&quot;English (Devon): Habitation name from Higher <i>Kingdon</i> in Alverdiscott, Devon 
or from <i>Kendon</i> in North Bovey, Devon. 
Both are from the Old English <i>cyning</i> KING + <i>d&#363;n </i>HILL. 
A variation of the name is Kindon.&quot;
</p>

<p>
The former is the most likely as Alverdiscott (Grid Ref. SS520252) lies part way between Bideford and
South Molton, about 12 miles West of South Molton.
</p>


<p>It should be borne in mind that when looking at C19th.&nbsp; and earlier
records and registers that the various officials, e.g. Census Enumerators,
Clergy, Registrars Of Births, Marriages and Deaths, often recorded the name
&quot;Kingdon&quot; incorrectly. They used the more commonly encountered name
&quot;Kingdom&quot;.
