<a href="../../maps/davies_maps/edge_st/edge_street_main.htm" target="main"

 Edge St</a>, Nut Grove, St Helens.
It was while she was living in Edge Street that her first child,

title="Bill Davies's Entry">
 William Alfred</a> (known as Bill)
was born in 1910.
</p>

<p>
Some time after William Alfred's birth they moved to a new house built by the
Hospital in Rainhill Road. This house, at 

<a href="../../maps/davies_maps/palatine/palatine_villas_main.htm" target="main"
title=" Map Showing Palatine Villas">
 Upper Palatine Villas</a>, was one of a row of substantial semi-detached houses. 
They were apparently among the first houses in the area to have electricity. 
Unfortunately the houses no longer exist, newer houses have been built on their site, but the original gate-posts still seem to be there.
It was while Ethelina was living there that her second child,

1913</a>.
</p>

<p>
By 1937, when Peggy Davies married, Ethelina had moved to a cottage in the grounds of the 
main site of the Rainhill Mental Hospital. 
This was known as 

<a href="../../maps/davies_maps/firemans/firemans_cottage_main.htm"
target="main" title=" Map Showing Fireman's Cottate">
 Fireman’s Cottage </a> and her husband, now being the Chief Officer of the 
Rainhill Mental Hospital Fire Brigade.
</p>

<p>
When William retired they moved to an end terrace house at 

<a href="../../Places%20&amp;%20Buildings/speakman_road/speakman_rd_main.htm"
target="main" title=" Photo Of 158 Speakman Road">
158 Speakman Road</a>, St Helens which they shared with their son Bill
and, after he married, his family.
</p>

<p>Her husband was never happy living there, it had no garden and he was a very
keen gardener, and they moved to an isolated cottage at 

<a
href="../../Places%20&amp;%20Buildings/berringtons_lane/berringtons_lane_main.htm"
target="main">
1 Berringtons Lane</a>, Rainford.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately while they were living there Ethelina became more and more
crippled by Rheumatoid Arthritis and eventually became bed-ridden. While he was alive her
husband continued to look after her there but, when William died in 1956, Ethelina
went to various Nursing Homes and eventually came to live with her daughter
before being admitted to the Geriatric Ward at Whiston Hospital Whiston, Prescott,
Lancashire.

She died on the

cause of death being Broncho-Pneumonia, Senility and Rheumatoid Arthritis.
