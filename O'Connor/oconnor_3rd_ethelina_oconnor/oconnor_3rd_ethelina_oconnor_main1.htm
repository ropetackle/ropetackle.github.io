<p>
Ethelina O'Connor was born at Leeds, Yorkshire on the 3<sup>rd</sup> January 1878 and was the first child of 

<a href="../oconnor_2nd_alice_williams/oconnor_2nd_alice_williams_frame.htm"
title=" Alice Louisa Williams Entry">
 Alice Louisa Williams</a>.<br>
Although she referred to 

<a href="../oconnor_2nd_james_oconnor/oconnor_2nd_james_oconnor_frame.htm"
title="James Daniel O'Connor's Entry">
James Daniel O'Connor</a> as her father it is not certain that he was. When she
was born her mother was only 16 or 17 years old&nbsp; and did not marry James
Daniel until

target="main" title="Alice Louisa Williams Marriage Certificate">
1880</a>. It seems almost certain that Ethelina was illegitimate.<br>
Confirmation of this comes from the fact that Ethelina always said that she had never had a Birth
Certificate and a detailed search of the Records in the Births Registers for 
England and Wales at the Family Records Centre, London has so far failed to find any trace of her birth.
It would thus appear that her birth was never registered. Also relevant is the
fact that in the

 1881 Census</a> Her name is given as &quot;Ethelina W
O'Connor&quot;, the &quot;W&quot; probably standing for Williams.
</p>

<p>
She had six brothers. These were:-

<p>
The first reference to her is in the
 1881 Census.
She was then 3 years old and living with her mother, her &quot;father&quot;,
James Daniel O'Connor and brother James at the house of her maternal 
grandmother 

<a href="../oconnor_1st_louisa_williams/oconnor_1st_louisa_williams_frame.htm"
title=" Louisa Williams Entry">
 Louisa Williams </a> at 18 Alfred Cross Street, Leeds.
Her &quot;father&quot; was a Smith Forge Man and her mother a Seamstress/Sewing Machine Hand.
</p>


<p>
When her younger brother Alfred Hartley was born in 

<a
href="../../Documents/Birth%20Certificates/1888_alfred_hartley_oconnor/1888_alfred_o'connor_bc_main.htm"
target="main" title=" Alfred Hartley O'Connor's Birth Certificate">
 1888 </a> the family were living at 16 Bywater Street, Leeds. James Daniel was now working as a Mill Labourer.
</p>


<p>
When the

target="main" title=" Ethelina's 1891 Census Entry">
1891</a> Census was taken the O'Connor family had moved to 4 Bywater Street.
Ethelina was 13 years old and still at school. She now had 5 brothers, James,
Edward, Robert, Alfred Hartley and Claude. James Daniel was working as a
Mechanical Engineer.
</p>


<p>
By the time that the 1901 Census was taken there had been a dramatic change in her family circumstances.
Her mother had died of Breast Cancer in November 1900 and she and her youngest brother Joseph, who was only 1 year old, 
were living with her Grandmother Louisa Williams at 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1901_williams_leeds/1901_williams_leeds_main.htm#3ethelina"
target="main" title=" Ethelina's 1901 Census Entry">
 15 Scarsdale Street</a>, Leeds.
Although she was now 23 years old she was not working.<br />
Her &quot;father&quot; James Daniel, who now worked as a Joiner, lived nearby, still at 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1901_oconnor_leeds/1901_oconnor_leeds_main.htm#2james"
target="main" title=" O'Connor Family 1901 Census Entry">
 4 Bywater Street </a> with three of her brothers, Robert, 
Alfred and Claude.


<p>
According to her daughter,
 Peggy Davies, Ethelina was not brought up to work, she 
was “brought up to be a lady”, and it was intended that she would make a good marriage.
This is born out by the fact that although she was 23 when the 1901 Census was taken, she had no 
occupation.
</p>

<p>
Some time after 1901, Ethelina and her Grandmother, Louisa Williams, moved to Liverpool to live with
Ethelina's 

<a href="../oconnor_2nd_mary_williams/oconnor_2nd_mary_williams_frame.htm"
title=" Mary Williams Entry">
Aunt Mary</a>, Louisa's daughter.
They lived somewhere near the centre of Liverpool, in the area between Mount Pleasant and Lime Street. 
Ethelina's daughter remembers, when she was young, going into Liverpool on the tram from Prescott and 
her mother pointing out a house and saying that it was there that she had been brought up.
</p>

<p>
Ethelina was a superb needle-woman, having apparently learnt the skills when a child from the girls who 
worked in her grandmother’s dressmaking workshop.
</p>
<p>
Again, according to Peggy Davies, Ethelina's Aunt Mary was well off and
had many wealthy friends 
amongst whom were the Costain family who founded the building firm of that name. 
Both families were pushing for Ethelina to marry one of the Costain sons but she did not want to do this 
and instead went to train as a nurse to escape the pressure. 
At that time nursing was considered to be an acceptable career for a &quot;lady&quot; as it involved a course of
training.
</p>

<p>
At some time she started working at the Rainhill Mental Asylum as a nurse. 
It was while she was working there that she met her future husband
