<p>
The doubt about the number of children is because the eldest, Ethelina, may not
have been his child. When James married Alice, Ethelina was already 2 years old.
</p>

<p>
The earliest reference to James Daniel is when he married Alice in Leeds on 

<a
href="../../Documents/Marriage%20Certificates/1880_williams_oconnor/1880_williams_oconnor_mc_main.htm"
title="James Daniel's Marriage Certificate" target="main">
10<sup>th</sup> April 1880</a>. Both he and Alice were living with her mother,

title="Louisa Williams Entry">
Louisa Williams</a>, at 18 Alfred Cross Street, Leeds. At the time he was
employed as a Forgeman.<br />
It is possible that he met Alice because he was lodging with her mother.
</p>

<p>
When the the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1881_oconnor_leeds/1881_oconnor_leeds_main.htm#2james"
target="main" title="James Daniel's 1881 Census Entry">
 1881 Census</a> was taken James was 23 years old, working as a Smith
Forge Man and still living at 18 Alfred Cross Road, Leeds with his mother-in-law Louisa Williams, wife Alice
Louisa and her two children, Ethelina and James.
</p>

<p>
When his son, Alfred Hartley, was born in 

<a
href="../../Documents/Birth%20Certificates/1888_alfred_hartley_oconnor/1888_alfred_o'connor_bc_main.htm"
target="main" title=" Alfred Hartley O'Connor's Birth Certificate">
 January 1888</a> he, Alice and their family had moved to 16 Bywater Street,
Leeds and he was working as a Mill Labourer.
</p>

<p>
James was still living in Bywater Street, although at No.4 not 16, when the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1891_oconnor_leeds/1891_oconnor_leeds_main.htm#2james"
target="main" title="James Daniel's 1891 Census Entry">
 1891
Census</a> was taken. He was now 33 years old and he was employed as a Mechanical
Engineer. By now he and Alice had 6 children.
</p>

<p>
In

target="main" title=" Copy Of Alice Louisa Williams Death Certificate">
November 1900</a> his life underwent a dramatic change. Alice died, aged 40,
from Breast Cancer leaving him with their youngest son Joseph, who was only a
year old. When she died his occupation was given on her Death Certificate as
that of a Wood Moulder.
</p>

<p>
When the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1901_oconnor_leeds/1901_oconnor_leeds_main.htm"
target="main" title="James Daniel's 1901 Census Entry">
 1901 Census</a> was taken, four months after Alice's death, the problem had
been sorted. James continued to live at 4 Bywater Street with 3 of his sons, Robert, Alfred and
Claude while
Ethelina and his son Joseph went to live with his mother-in-law, Louisa Williams,
who lived nearby in Scarsdale Street.<br />
The 1901 Census return gives James age as 47 and his birthplace as Ireland. He
was working as a Joiner.
</p>

<p>
The last mention of James is when Ethelina married on the 28<sup>th</sup> April 1909.
