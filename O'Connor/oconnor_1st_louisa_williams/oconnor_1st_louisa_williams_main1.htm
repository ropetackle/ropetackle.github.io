The earliest reference to her is in the

target="_self" title=" Louisa's Entry in 1881 Census">
 1881 Census</a>.
She was 48, working as a Dressmaker and living at 18 Alfred Cross Street, Leeds. 
Although the Census Return describes her as being married and not as a widow there is no mention of any 
husband and she is given as the Head of the Household.<br>
Living with her at Alfred Cross Street were her daughter Alice, Alice's husband

When the 

<a

target="_self" title=" Louisa's Entry in 1891 Census">
 1891 Census</a> was taken she had moved and was living on her own at 14 Bywater
Sreet, Leeds. She was now 57 years old and is described as being a widow.
Although her profession is given as being that of Dressmaker, her employment
status is shown as being &quot;neither employed or unemployed&quot;. This would
seem to support the belief that she had her own dressmaking business.
</p>


<p>
Louisa is next mentioned in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1901_williams_leeds/1901_williams_leeds_main.htm#1louisa"
target="_self" title=" Louisa's Entry in 1901 Census">
 1901 Census</a>. She was now 68, no longer working and living at 
15 Scarsdale Street, Leeds. Also living with her was her grandaughter, Ethelina O'Connor
and her youngest grandson, 

<a href="../oconnor_3rd_joseph_oconnor/oconnor_3rd_joseph_oconnor_frame.htm"
target="_top" title=" Joseph O'Connor's Entry">
Joseph</a>. The reason for this was that her daughter Alice had died in November
1900. Alice's only daughter, Ethelina, and her 1year old son had gone to live
with their grandmother while Alice's husband lived nearby with the rest of the
children.<br>
Also living in Louisa's house was a lodger&nbsp; James M<sup>c</sup>Gowan, a 44 year old Farrier 
from Scotland.
</p>

<p>
Some time after the 1901 Census, Louisa and her granddaughter Ethelina moved to live with
Louisa's daughter 
Mary somewhere in the centre of Liverpool, in the area between Mount Pleasant and Lime
Street.
</p>


<p>
According to her great-grandaughter Margaret Ethel Davies, Louisa had her own dressmaking business and 
employed several girls.
