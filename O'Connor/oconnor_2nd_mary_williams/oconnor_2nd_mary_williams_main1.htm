Mary Williams was the daughter of Richard Williams, a Shopkeeper, and his wife <a href="../oconnor_1st_louisa_williams/oconnor_1st_louisa_williams_frame.htm"

Christmas Steps</a>. 

<p>
She is thought to have had at least one brother and one sister. These were:-

<p>
According to her great-niece,
 Peggy Davies, Mary married either a German or 
someone with a Germanic sounding name and they ran a Guesthouse in Liverpool, somewhere in the area between 
Mount Pleasant and Lime Street. 
She remembers her mother,

target="_top" title=" Ethelina O'Connor's Entry">
Ethelina O'Connor,</a> once pointing out a tall multi-storey house as they were 
travelling on the tram into Liverpool and being told that it was there that she, i.e. Ethelina, had 
been brought up by her Aunt Mary.
</p>

<p>
At some time after 1901 Mary's mother, Louisa Williams, and Mary's niece 

 Ethelina O'Connor, Alice’s daughter and 
eldest child, moved from Leeds to Liverpool to live with Mary.
</p>

<p>
Mary and her husband seem to have been fairly well off and apparently had many wealthy friends including the 
Costain family. 
These were wealthy builders who founded the large building group, Costains.
</p>

<p>
In her old age Mary Williams became ill and lived with Ethelina O'Connor and Ethelina’s husband

William Davies</a> at Palatine Cottages, Rainhill Road, Nut Grove, St Helens, Lancashire. 
However when Ethelina was expecting her second child 
she found that she could not cope with the ailing Mary, a young son and pregnancy. 
Mary therefore went into Whiston Hospital - which was the former workhouse and 
therefore very much looked upon by old people as a place of destitution - where she 
died just before Peggy Davies was born in 1913.
