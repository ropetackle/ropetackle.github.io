<p>
It is not clear whether James Daniel was the father of Ethelina. It seems
unlikely as Alice was only about 16 or 17 years old when Ethelina was born. Also
in the <a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1881_oconnor_leeds/1881_oconnor_leeds_main.htm#2alice"
target="main" title=" Alice's 1881 Census Entry">1881 Census</a>  Ethelina's
name is given as &quot;Ethelina W O'Connor&quot;, the &quot;W&quot; possibly
standing for Williams. 
</p>

<p>
The earliest reference to Alice is her 

<a
href="../../Documents/Marriage%20Certificates/1880_williams_oconnor/1880_williams_oconnor_mc_main.htm"
target="main" title="Alice Louisa's Marriage Certificate">
Marriage Certificate</a> for her marriage to James Daniel O'Connor on 10<sup>th</sup>April
1880. When she married she was 19 years old and already had a 2 year old
daughter Ethelina. Both she and James Daniel were living at 18 Alfred Cross
Street, Leeds. This house appears to have been her mother's. Alice seems to have
been unable to write as she signed the Marriage Register with an &quot;<b>X</b>&quot;. 
</p>

<p>
 A year later when the&nbsp; 1881 Census was taken she, James
 Daniel and her two eldest children, Ethelina and James,
were still living with her mother at 18 Alfred Cross Street, Leeds. Alice was 20 years
 old and worked as a Seamstress/Sewing Machine Hand, possibly for her mother who was a
Dressmaker. 
</p>

<p>
The next mention of Alice is the

Alice was now living at 16 Bywater Street, Leeds. Again when she signed the
Birth Register she signed with an &quot;<b>X</b>&quot;.
