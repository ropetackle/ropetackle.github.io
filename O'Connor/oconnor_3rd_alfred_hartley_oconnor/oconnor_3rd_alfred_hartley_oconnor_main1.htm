The earliest reference to him is his Birth Certificate. When he was born the
family were living at 16 Bywater Street, Leeds. His father worked as a Mill Labourer. His
birth was registered by his mother who signed the Birth Certificate with an <b>&quot;X&quot;</b>
instead of her name.

<p>
The next mention of him is in the 

<a target="main" title=" Alfred's 1891 Census Entry"
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1891_oconnor_leeds/1891_oconnor_leeds_main.htm#3alfred">
1891</a> Census. Alfred was 3 years old and they were living at 4 Bywater
Street. His father worked as a Mechanical Engineer.

When the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1901_oconnor_leeds/1901_oconnor_leeds_main.htm#3alfred"
target="main" title=" Alfred's 1901 Census Entry">
 1901</a> Census was taken he was 13 years old and
working as a &quot;Lakes Coalout&quot;. It isn't known what this occupation was,
it may be an error in the transcription of the Census Return due to a misreading
of the manuscript entry. He was living at 4 Bywater Street and his father was now
working as a Joiner.<br>
There had, however, been a change in the family, his mother had died the
previous November.
