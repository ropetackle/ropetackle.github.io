 Although modern day Easthorpe is a small hamlet outside Bottesford it
appears that, in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, Easthorpe was all of the area of
Bottesford south of the River Devon. The Church was therefore in Bottesford but
Church Street was in Easthorpe. This would explain why the 19<sup>th</sup>
Century Census Returns for Easthorpe show that its population was much larger
that its present size would indicate.
