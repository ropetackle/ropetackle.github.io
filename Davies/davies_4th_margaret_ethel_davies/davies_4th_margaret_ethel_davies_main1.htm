<p>
She was born at 

<a href="../../maps/davies_maps/palatine/palatine_villas_main.htm"

 Upper Palatine Villas</a>, Rainhill Road, <nobr>Nut Grove,</nobr> St Helens on

<p>
She had one brother,

 title=" Bill Davies's Entry">
 William Alfred</a> (known as Bill)
</p>

<p>
The house at Upper Palatine Villas was one of a row of substantial semi-detached houses that had just 
been built by the Hospital and were amongst the first houses in the area to have electricity.
The houses no longer exist, newer houses having been built on the site although, in November 1999, 
the original gate-posts of the front paths were still there.
</p>

<p>
When Peggy left school she went to work for St Helens Corporation in the the
office of their Transport Department.</p>


<p>
Peggy was a keen cyclist and a member of the St Helens section of the Cyclist
Touring Club and it was through this interest that she met

title=" Copy Of Peggy's Marriage Certificate">
 19<sup>th</sup> June 1937</a></p>


<p>
When she married she was living with her parents in a cottage known as

<a href="../../maps/davies_maps/firemans/firemans_cottage_main.htm" 
target="_self" title=" Map Showing Fireman's Cottage">
Fireman’s Cottage</a> in the Hospital grounds on the East side of Rainhill Road.
There is now no trace of this cottage. They had moved there when her father
became the Chief Officer of the Hospital's fire brigade.</p>


<p>
Although
she was living with her parents at Fireman's Cottage when she married, the address on
her Marriage Certificate is given as 39 Rainhill Road. The reason for this was that she wanted to get married at Rainhill Parish
Church but unfortunately her home was just outside the Rainhill Parish boundary.
To get round this she left a suitcase at the house of a friend who lived in the
Parish at 39 Rainhill Road and gave that as her home address.
