<p>
Thomas's first six children were all born in Newmarket and it seems that it was
some time between about 1847 and 1850 that he and his family moved to 
<a href="../../maps/davies_maps/amlwch/amlwch_main.htm" 
target="_self" title=" Map showing Amlwch">
Amlwch, Anglesey </a>
</p>


<p>
The first reference to him is in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Birth%20Certificates/1850_edward_davies/1850_edward_davies_bc_main.htm"
target="main" title="Edward Davies's Birth Certificate">
 Birth Certificate</a> of his son Edward who was
born in 1850.<br>
Thomas and his family were living in New Street, Amlwch and he was employed as
a Bricklayer. He does not seem to have been able to write, instead of signing
the Birth Register he &quot;made his mark&quot; with a <b>X</b>.

title=" Thomas's 1851 Census Entry" target="_self">1851 Census</a> was taken
Thomas was 40 years old,
still a Bricklayer and living with  Winifred and their seven children 
in Amlwch.
