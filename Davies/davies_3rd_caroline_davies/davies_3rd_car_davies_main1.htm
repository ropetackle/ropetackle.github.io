<p>
Her niece, Peggy Davies, says that Caroline married a Roman Catholic and was 
treated as an &quot;outcast&quot; from the family by her sister
 Marion because of this. 
Following Caroline's marriage, Marion never spoke to her sister again nor would she 
talk about her!
</p>

<p>
One of Caroline's children, Bill, joined the RAF during World War II as a pilot. 
After a tour of duty in England and another training  pilots in Canada he was killed 
over Holland while flying as a night-fighter pilot.
