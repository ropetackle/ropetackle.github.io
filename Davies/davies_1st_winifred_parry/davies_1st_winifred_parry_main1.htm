<p>
Winifred's first six children were all born in Newmarket and it seems that it
was some time between about 1847 and 1850 that she and her family moved to 

<a href="../../maps/davies_maps/amlwch/amlwch_main.htm" target="_self"
title=" Map showing Amlwch">
Amlwch, Anglesey</a>.
</p>

<p>
The first reference to her is in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Birth%20Certificates/1850_edward_davies/1850_edward_davies_bc_main.htm"
target="main" title="Edward Davies's Birth Certificate">
Birth Certificate</a> of her son Edward who was born in 1850.<br>
She, Thomas and their family were living in New Street, Amlwch and Thomas was
employed as a Bricklayer. He does not seem to have been able to write, instead
of signing the Birth Register he &quot;made his mark&quot; with a <b>X</b>.
</p>

<p>
Winifred is next mentioned in the 

<a 
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1851_davies_amlwch/1851_davies_amlwch_main.htm#1winifred"
title=" Winifred's 1851 Census Entry" target="_self">
1851 Census</a>. She was then 39 years old and still living with  Thomas and their seven children, 

in Amlwch.
