William and his parents were still living with his

Grandfather, William <b>  </b> Pennill, having died. He was now 12 years old and had
another sister,
Marion, and two brothers,
Thomas and
Edward.<br>
Also living there were his Aunt Georgina and her husband, William
Stothart.
</p>

<p>
William was apparently quite clever and when at school won a scholarship.
Unfortunately he had to leave school to start earning a living and couldn't take
advantage of it.
When he left school he trained as a Plumber and Gas Fitter.&nbsp;

Liverpool He was 22 years old and working as a Gas Fitter. He now had two
more sisters,
Georgina and
Winifred.
</p>

<p>
While he was working as a Gas Fitter he was involved in a gas explosion and
suffered serious burns to his face and as a result spent a
long time in hospital. 
It was because of these burns that he grew his beard.
</p>

<p>
He later became a Male Nurse at Rainhill Mental Hospital - why he did this
isn't known but it must have been safer than being a Gas Fitter!

It was while he was working as a Male Nurse at Rainhill Mental Hospital that
