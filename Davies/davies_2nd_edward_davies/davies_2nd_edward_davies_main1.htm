<p>
The earliest reference to Edward is his Birth Certificate. When he was born his
parents were living in New Street, Amlwch and his father worked as a Bricklayer.<br>
His father does not seem to have been able to write as in the Birth Register he
&quot;made his mark&quot; with an <b>X</b> instead of signing the Register.
</p>

<p>
Edward is next mentioned in the 

<a 
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1851_davies_amlwch/1851_davies_amlwch_main.htm#2edward"
title=" Edward's 1851 Census Entry" target="main">
1851 Census</a>. 
He was now 8 months old and the family were still in Amlwch and his father was
still a Bricklayer.
</p>

<p>
The next mentioned of Edward is in the

 target="main" title=" Edward's 1881 Census Entry">
1881 Census</a>. He was now 30 years old and working as a Bricklayer in
Liverpool. He was married and living with his wife Margaret <b> </b> and their two eldest children,
 William 
and
 Caroline, with his father and mother-in-law,

</p>

<p>
He was still living at 9 Elm Grove when the 

<a

 target="main" title=" Edward's 1891 Census Entry">
 1891 Census</a> was taken.
He was now 40 and his occupation is given as that of a Bricksetter. 
His family had grown and he and
 Margaret had three more children,
Marion,
 Thomas and
Edward. 
The house belonged to his mother-in-law
 Marion Pennill <b>
 </b>and his sister-in-law
 Georgina and her husband were also
lived there.
</p>

9 Elm Grove was still his home when the

 target="main" title=" Edward's 1901 Census Entry">
 1901 Census</a> was taken.
He was now 50 years old and still employed as a Bricklayer. 
His family had again grown and there were two more children,
 Georgina and
Winifred. His mother-in-law, Marion, seems to have died as Edward was now the Head of the Household.

<p>
When his son
William married in 1909 the
