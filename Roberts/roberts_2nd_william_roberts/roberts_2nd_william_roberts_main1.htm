<h4 class=intro>
William Roberts is a Great-Great-Great-Grandfather of Faye, Jenny and Kate Lloyd and of Chloe and 
Daniel Marshall.
</h4>

<hr class=bfam />

<p>
William Roberts was born in Stockport, Cheshire in either 1848 or 1849.
Nothing is known about his parents.
</p>

<p>
He married Fanny Roberts (her maiden name isn't known) and they had one child, Frances Martha Clio.
</p>

<hr class=bfam />

<p>
The earliest reference to William is in 1894 and is in the Marriage Certificate of his Daughter, Frances.
This describes him as a Coastguardsman.
</p>

<p>
William is next mentioned in the 1901 Census.
He was 52 years old, living at the Coastguard Station, Flamborough, Yorkshire with his wife Fanny and
was the Coastguard Chief Officer at the Station.
</p>

<p>
His great-grandson, John Tate, remembers hearing as a child a story that, following an incident in the 
Flamborough area for which William Roberts was blamed, he was either sacked by the Coastguard Service or 
reprimanded.
</p>

<p>
Nothing is known about William prior to these dates.
There is no mention of him in the 1891 Census Return for Flamborough Coastguard Station.<br />
It is thought that he was at one time stationed in the London area, possibly at Sheerness, Kent.
This would explain why both his wife and Frances were born in Woolwich.<br />
It is quite likely that he had been in the Royal Navy, probably as a Petty Officer, and when he had 
completed his 21 years of service he was appointed a Coastguard.
In the C19<sup>th</sup> it was not unusual for Royal Navy Petty Officers with a good service record 
to be appointed as Coastguards when they were discharged - it was, in effect, a form of State pension.
A career in the Royal Navy could explain his connections with the Sheerness or Woolwich area.
</p>

<p>
There is some doubt in the Tate family as to whether Frances Martha Clio was in fact his daughter.
It is possible that she was the child of someone else, maybe an unmarried relative, and was unofficially 
adopted by William Roberts and Fanny and brought up as their child. 
This was not an unusually practice in the C19<sup>th</sup>.
