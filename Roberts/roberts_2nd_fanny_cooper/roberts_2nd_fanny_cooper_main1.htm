<h4 class=intro>
Fanny Roberts is a Great-Great-Great-Grandmother of Faye, Jenny and Kate Lloyd and of 
Chloe and Daniel Marshall.
</h4>

<hr class=bfam />

<p>
Fanny Roberts was born in Woolwich, London in either 1850 or 1851. 
Her maiden name isn't known.
</p>

<p>
She married William Roberts and they had one child, Frances Martha Clio.
</p>

<hr class=bfam />

<p>
The only reference to Fanny is in the 1901 Census.
She was 50 years old and living at the Coastguard Station, Flamborough, Yorkshire where her husband was 
the Chief Officer of the Coastguard.
</p>

<p>
Although William Roberts is shown as the father of Frances Martha Clio on her Marriage Certificate, it is not
definitely known whether Fanny and William were her parents.<br />
It is possible that they were not and that Frances was the daughter of someone else, 
maybe an unmarried relative, and was unofficially adopted by William Roberts and his wife and 
brought up as their child. 
This was not an unusual practice in the C19<sup>th</sup>.
