<p>
Frances Martha Clio Roberts was born in Woolwich, London in either 1870 or 1871.

<p>
Frances is thought to have been the daughter of William Roberts, a Coastguard, and his wife Fanny although 
there is some doubt in the Tate family that this was the case.<br />
There is no record of the birth of any Frances Martha Clio Roberts in the Registers of Births for the 
years around 1871.
It is thought that she may possibly have been the child of someone else, maybe an unmarried relative, 
and that she was unofficially adopted by William Roberts and his wife and brought up as their child. 
This was not an unusually practice in the C19<sup>th</sup>.
</p>

<p>
Some time before 1984 her father became a Coastguard at Flamborough Coastguard Station at Flamborough 
Head in Yorkshire.
</p>

<p>
Frances went into Service and in 1894 she was working as Housemaid for Mrs. Rosalie M Barram the wife of
Henry Barram, a Leeds Woollen Merchant.
The Barrams lived at Strafford House, Stainbeck Lane, Chapeltown, Leeds.
</p>
        
<p>
It was while Frances was working for Mrs. Barram she met David Tate who was working as a Domestic Gardener at a 
house in Weetwood Lane, Headingley, Leeds. 
She became pregnant and they married at Leeds Register Office on 17<sup>th</sup> November 1894.
<p>

<p>
Her Marriage Certificate is the earliest reference to her.
