<p>
When Frances Martha Clio Roberts and David Tate married in 1894, they went to live at 
5 Highbury Lane, Headingley, Leeds and it was here that their first child, Florence, was born in January 1895.
Florence's Birth Certificate shows that David Tate was still working as a Domestic Gardener.<br />
The house in Highbury Lane was a typical end-of-terrace &quot;back-to-back&quot; house.
As can be seen from the photograph of it, the house seems to be a typical &quot;two-up-and-two-down&quot; 
with communal lavatories at the end of the terrace block.
</p>

<p>
The next mention of Frances is on the Birth Certificate of their second child, John, who was born in October 
1896.
The family had by then moved from Highbury Lane to Fulneck, near Pudsey, Leeds.
The reason for the move was that David Tate had become the Golf Professional at Fulneck Golf Club.
</p>

<p>
At the end of 1897 the family moved again.
This time they left Yorkshire and moved to South Wales as David Tate had become the Golf
Professional at Ashburnham Golf Club which is at Pembrey near Burry Port, a few kilometers west of Llanelli
in Carmarthenshire.
When their third child, Robert Frederick, was born in January 1899 they were living at Carway Street,
Pembrey.
</p>
         
<p>
The circumstances of the death of Robert Frederick were particularly tragic.
He died, killed in action in World War I, on 23rd October 1918.<br /> 
The letter which the War Office sent on the 9<sup>th</sup> November 1918 to his parents to tell them of 
his death, arrived on 12th November, the day after the Armistice had been signed and the war ended.
The effect of this on them can hardly be imagined.
On the 11<sup>th</sup> November they heard that the War was over and must have been giving thanks that
their son was now safe. The next day they heard that he was dead.
</p>

<p>
When the 1901 Census was taken, Frances and her family were living at 11 Carway Street, Pembrey.
She was 30 years old had born another child, Edward Reginald, who was 5 months old.
</p>
 	   
<p>
By the time Frances's sixth child, Marjorie, was born in January 1905 they were living at 38 Bryn Glas, 
Pen-y-darren, Merthyr Tydfil.
</p>

<p>
Frances continued to live at 38 Bryn Glas right up until just before she died.
<p>

<p>
She died on the 13<sup>th</sup> May 1947, aged 76, while staying with her daughter Marjorie at 28 Priory Avenue, 
Hastings.
Her Death Certificate states that her death was the result of myocardial degeneration and coronary sclerosis.
