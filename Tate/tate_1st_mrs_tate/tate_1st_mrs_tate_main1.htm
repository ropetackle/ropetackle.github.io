<h4 class=intro>
Mrs. Tate is a Great-Great-Great-Great-Grandmother of Faye, Jenny and Kate Lloyd and of 
Chloe and Daniel Marshall.
</h4>

<hr class=bfam />

<p>
Mrs. Tate was born in or around Longtown, Cumberland.
</p>

<p>
She had one known child. This was her son George.
</p>

<hr class=bfam />

<p>
Virtually nothing is known about Mrs Tate apart from the fact that she is thought to have been born in or 
around Longtown, Cumberland.
Longtown is 6 miles north of Carlisle on the A7 and is near the Scottish Border.
</p>

<hr class=bsfam />

<p>
According to family history Mrs Tate went to work as a maid at a large house in Evening Hill, a hamlet in the 
Parish of Thursby which lies on the A595 about 7 miles South West of Carlisle. 
The house belonged to the Robinson family.
</p> 

<p>
In about 1828 or 1829 she became pregnant by the son of the family and his father insist that they marry. 
They were married at Arthuret Church, which is about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> mile south of Longtown, and 
the marriage is apparently recorded in the Marriage Register of the church.
</p> 

<p>
The story continues that, when they came out of the church, young Mr. Robinson immediately ran away to 
South Africa. 
In disgust George Tate's mother changed her name back to Tate and brought George up as a Tate.
</p> 

<p>
When Robinson died it could not be proved that George was his son as there was no Birth Certificate. 
He therefore died <i>in testate</i> and as there was no heir his estate went to the Government.
</p> 

<p>
There is more information on this in the letter which was sent to Marjorie Tate in 1960 by Jack Coulthard, 
the husband of Dora Tate, one of Marjorie's cousins.
