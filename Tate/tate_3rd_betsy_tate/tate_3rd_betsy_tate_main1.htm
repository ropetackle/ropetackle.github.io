<p>
Betsy Tate was born sometime between 1854 and 1857 in Longtown, Cumberland.
She was the second child of George Tate and Elizabeth Huggon.
</p>

<p>
Betsy had seven brothers and two sisters. These were:-
</p>

<ul>
		<li>Thomas</li>
		<li>James</li>
		<li>George</li>
		<li>Mary</li>
		<li>Edward</li>
		<li>David</li>
		<li>John</li>
		<li>Sarah</li>
		<li>Robert</li>
</ul>

<hr class=bnonfam />

<p>
Betsy Tate was born in Longtown, which is on the A7, about 6 miles north of Carlisle, and near the 
Scottish Border.<br />
It is not clear when she was born as there are errors in the ages given for her in the Census Returns.
According to the 1871 Census she was born in 1854 or 1855.
However the age given for her in the 1881 Census would mean that she was born in 1856 or 1857, 
while that from from the 1891 Census would give 1861 or 1862.
</p>
		
<p>
Some time between about 1863 and 1866 the Tate family moved from Longtown to the small Estate
village of Rickerby, in the Parish of Stanwix.
</p>

<p>
Rickerby is on the north bank of the River Eden, 
about <font size="1"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></font> mile east of Carlisle and 
just off the A689. 
The village "belonged" to the MacInnes family who lived at Rickerby House.<br />
Descriptions of Rickerby, based on the 1881 and 1891 Census Returns and other documents, 
are given elsewhere in this family history.
</p>

<p>
The earliest reference to Betsy is in the 1871 Census.
She was 16 years old and living with her parents in Rickerby.
</p>

<p>
The next mention of Betsy is in the 1881 Census.
She was living with her parents in Rickerby and is described as being 24 years old, not 
26 as would be expected from the previous Census Return.
She is also described as being an Unemployed Domestic Servant.
</p>

<p>
By the time of the 1891 Census Betsy was no longer living at home.<br />
However it is almost certain that she was still in Rickerby as the Census Return records that a 
Betsy Tate, born in Longtown, was living at a house in Rickerby called "The Beeches" as the Housemaid. 
Although the age of this Betsy is given as 29, not 34 or 36 as she would have been, it is quite likely 
that they were the one and the same.
It was probably not unusual for the head of the house not to know the ages of their servants.
