<p>
Robert Frederick Tate was the third child of David Tate and Frances Martha Clio Roberts.
He was born on 11<sup>th</sup> January 1899 at 11 Carway Street, Pembrey, Carmarthenshire.
</p>

<p>
He had four brothers and three sisters. These were:-
</p>

<ul>
		<li>Florence</li>
		<li>John</li>
		<li>Edward Reginald</li>
		<li>Dorothy Alma</li>
		<li>Marjorie</li>
		<li>Victor Stuart</li>
		<li>George James Graham</li>
</ul>

<p>
He died, killed in action, on 23<sup>rd</sup> October 1918.
</p>

<hr class=bnonfam />

<p>
The earliest reference to Robert is his Birth Certificate.
He was born on 11<sup>th</sup> January 1899 at 11 Carway Street, Pembrey, Carmarthenshire.
When he was born his father was the Golf Professional at Ashburnham Golf Club, Burry Port, Carmarthenshire.
</p>

<p>
Robert is next mentioned in the 1901 Census.
He was 2 years old and living with his parents and one sister, Florence, and two brothers, John and Edward, 
at Carway Street.
</p>

<p>
During the 1st World War, although he was under age, Robert enlisted as a Private in the Welsh Regiment.
Initially he was with the 8<sup>th</sup> Battalion and served with them in Gallipoli and in Mesopotamia.
In 1918 he was with the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion in France. 
He died, killed in action, on 23rd October 1918, aged 19 and has no known grave.
</p>
   
<p>
His name is on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Vis-en-Artois Memorial, Pas de Calais, 
France Memorial, Panel 7. 
</p>
   
<p>
The Vis-en-Artois Memorial is in the grounds of the Vis-en-Artois British Cemetery which is west of 
Haucourt on the north side of the main road. 
This Memorial bears the names of over 9,000 men who fell in the period from 8<sup>th</sup> August 1918 to 
the date of the Armistice in the<br />
</p>

<blockquote><i>&quot;Advance to Victory in Picardy and Artois, between the Somme and
Loos, and who have no known grave. 
They belonged to the forces of Great Britain and Ireland and South Africa...&quot;<br />
(Quote from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Record of Commemoration for Robert Frederick Tate)
</i></blockquote>
   

<p>
The circumstances of his death were particularly tragic.
As already mentioned, he died on 23<sup>rd</sup> October 1918. 
The letter which the War Office sent on the 9<sup>th</sup> November 1918 to his parents to tell them of 
his death, arrived on 12<sup>th</sup> November, the day after the Armistice had been signed and the war ended.
The effect of this on them can hardly be imagined.<br />
On the 11<sup>th</sup> November they heard that the War was over and must have been giving thanks that
Robert was now safe. 
The next day they heard that he was dead.
