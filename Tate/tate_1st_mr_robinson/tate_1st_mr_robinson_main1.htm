<h4 class=intro>
Mr Robinson is alleged to be a Great-Great-Great-Great-Grandfather of Faye, Jenny and Kate Lloyd and of 
Chloe and Daniel Marshall.
</h4>

<hr class=bfam />

<p>
According to family history Mr. Robinson, his first names are not known, was the father of George Tate. 
</p>

<p>
His family lived at Evening Hill, a hamlet in the Parish of Thursby which lies on the A595 about 7 miles 
South West of Carlisle and George Tate’s mother went there as a maid. 
In about 1828 or 1829 Mr. Robinson, who was the son of the family, made her pregnant and his father 
insisted that the couple marry.
</p>

<p>
They were married at Athuret Church, which is about ½ mile South of Longtown, where the marriage is 
apparently recorded in the Marriage Register of the Church.
</p>

<p>
The story continues that, when they came out of the Church, Robinson ran away and went to South Africa. 
In disgust George Tate’s mother changed her name back to Tate and brought George up as a Tate.
</p>

<p>
When Robinson died it could not be proved that George was his son as there was no Birth Certificate. 
He therefore died <i>in testate</i> and as there was no heir his estate went to the government.
</p>

<p>
There is more information on this in the letter which was sent to Marjorie Tate in 1960 by Jack Coulthard, 
the husband of Dora Tate, one of Marjorie's cousins.
