<h4 class=intro>
George Tate is a Great-Great-Great-Grandfather of Faye, Jenny and Kate Lloyd and of 
Chloe and Daniel Marshall.
</h4>

<hr class=bfam />

<p>
George Tate was born in Longtown, Cumberland in about 1828 or 1829.
He is reputed to be the son of a Mrs. Tate and a Mr. Robinson.
</p>

<p>
He married Elizabeth Huggon and they had ten children. These were:-
</p>

<ul>
		<li>Thomas</li>
		<li>Betsy</li>
		<li>James</li>
		<li>George</li>
		<li>Mary</li>
		<li>Edward</li>
		<li>David</li>
		<li>John</li>
		<li>Sarah</li>
		<li>Robert</li>
</ul>

<hr class=bfam />

<p>
George was born at Longtown, Cumberland which is where his mother came from. 
Longtown is near the Scottish Border, about 6 miles north of Carlisle on the A7.
</p>

<p>
According to the Tate family history, George's mother went to work as a maid at a house belonging to a family 
called Robinson in Evening Hill, a hamlet in the Parish of Thursby.
Thursby lies on the A595 about 7 miles South West of Carlisle.<br />
The story goes that in about 1828 or 1829 his mother became pregnant by the son of the family and 
the son's father insist that they marry. 
They were married at Arthuret Church, which is about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> mile south of Longtown, 
and the marriage is apparently recorded in the Marriage Register of the church.<br />
The story continues that, when they came out of the church, young Mr. Robinson immediately ran away to 
South Africa. 
In disgust George Tate's mother changed her name back to Tate and brought George up as a Tate.<br/>
When young Mr. Robinson died it could not be proved that George was his son because there was no 
Birth Certificate for George. 
Young Mr. Robinson therefore died <i>in testate</i> and his estate went to the Government as there was no heir.
</p> 

<p>
There is more information on this in the letter which was sent to Marjorie Tate in 1960 by Jack Coulthard, 
the husband of Dora Tate, one of Marjorie's cousins.
</p> 

<p>
I am not sure  whether this is true. 
The 1841 Census Return for Evening Hill only gives two families called Robinson. 
One is a Mrs. Robinson, aged 65 who appears to be a Charwoman, and the other is a William Robinson, 
a miller, aged 35. 
More research on this is needed.
</p> 

<p>
George married Elizabeth Huggon who was also from Longtown and they lived in the Longtown area for 
several years. 
His first five children were born there.
</p>

<p>
However some time between about 1863 and 1866 the family moved from Longtown to the small Estate village of 
Rickerby, in the Parish of Stanwix.
</p>

<p>
Rickerby is on the north bank of the River Eden, 
about <font size="1"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></font> mile east of Carlisle and 
just off the A689. 
The village "belonged" to the MacInnes family who lived at Rickerby House.<br />
Descriptions of Rickerby, based on the 1881 and 1891 Census Returns and other documents, are given elsewhere 
in this family history.
</p>

<p>
The earliest reference to George Tate is on the Birth Certificate of his son David who was born at Rickerby 
on 18th July 1867.
He was then working as a Farm Labourer.<br />
On David's Birth Certificate there is a misspelling, George's surname is give as &quot;Tait&quot; 
not &quot;Tate&quot;.
</p>

<p>
When the 1871 Census was taken George and Elizabeth were still living at Rickerby.
He was 42 years old and still working as a Farm Labourer.
By now he and Elizabeth had eight children.
</p>

<p>
George was still living at Rickerby when the 1881 Census was taken.
He was 52 years old and is described as an Agricultural Labourer.
He and Elizabeth had ten children, although two, Thomas and James, were no 
longer living at home.
</p>

<p>
When the 1891 Census was taken George was 62 years old and he and Elizabeth were still at Rickerby.
He no longer worked as an Agricultural labourer, his occupation being given as that of a Fisherman.<br />
According to that Census Return, which gave the address of the house simply as "Cottage" with no name or 
number, the house had 4 occupied rooms. 
This house is shown in the photograph of the Tate's house taken in the 1980s and was probably the same one 
that they were occupying in 1881.<br />
Living in the cottage with him and Elizabeth were four of their children, Mary, David, John and Robert 
and also a 9 year old lodger, a schoolgirl called Rose Squires.
</p>

<p>
When his son David married in 1894, George was still working as a fisherman.
