<h4 class=intro>
Elizabeth Huggon was a Great-Great-Great-Grandmother of Faye, Jenny and Kate Lloyd and of 
Chloe and Daniel Marshall.
</h4>

<hr class=bfam />

<p>
Elizabeth Huggon was born in Longtown, Cumberland in about 1830 or 1831.
She was a daughter of James Huggon, a Cotton Weaver, and his wife Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth had at least one brother and one sister. These were:-
</p>

<ul>
		<li>Edward</li>
		<li>Margaret</li>
</ul>

<p>
Her mother died in 1837 when Elizabeth was about 6 or 7
</p>

<p>
She married George Tate and they had ten children. These were:-
</p>

<ul>
		<li>Thomas</li>
		<li>Betsy</li>
		<li>James</li>
		<li>George</li>
		<li>Mary</li>
		<li>Edward</li>
		<li>David</li>
		<li>John</li>
		<li>Sarah</li>
		<li>Robert</li>
</ul>

<p>
Elizabeth died at Rickerby from Bronchitis and Asthma on 24 May 1901 aged 69.
</p>

<hr class=bfam />

<p>
The earliest reference to Elizabeth is in the 1841 Census.
She was then 10 years old and living in Netherby Street, Longtown with her father and brother and sister.
There is no mention of her mother who had died when Elizabeth was about 6 or 7
</p>

<p>
Longtown is near the Scottish Border, about 6 miles north of Carlisle on the A7 and her family appears to be 
one of long standing in the Longtown area as there are a large number of Huggons recorded in the 
Christening Records of the Parish Church of Athuret.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth married George Tate who was also from Longtown and they lived in the Longtown area for several years. 
Her first five children were born there.
</p>

<p>
However some time between about 1863 and 1866 the family moved from Longtown to the small Estate village of 
Rickerby, in the Parish of Stanwix.
</p>

<p>
Rickerby is on the north bank of the River Eden, 
about <font size="1"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></font> 
mile east of Carlisle and just off the A689. 
The village "belonged" to the Macinnes family who lived at Rickerby House.<br />
Descriptions of Rickerby, based on the 1881 and 1891 Census Returns and other documents, are given 
elsewhere in this family history.
</p>

<p>
The next mention of Elizabeth is on the Birth Certificate of her son David who was born on 
18<sup>th</sup> July 1867.
</p>

<p>
When the 1871 Census was taken Elizabeth was still living at Rickerby and by then had eight children.
She was 40 years old.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth was still living at Rickerby when the 1881 Census was taken.
She was 50 years old and she and George had ten children, although two, Thomas and James, were no 
longer living at home.
</p>

<p>
When the 1891 Census was taken Elizabeth was 60 years old and she and George were still at Rickerby.<br />
According to that Census Return, which gave the address of the house simply as "Cottage" with no name or 
number, the house had 4 occupied rooms. 
This house is shown in the photograph of the Tate's house taken in the 1980s and was probably the same one 
that they were occupying in 1881.<br />
Living in the cottage with her and George were four of their children, Mary, David, John and Robert 
and also a 9 year old lodger, a schoolgirl called Rose Squires.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth died at Rickerby on 24<sup>th</sup> May 1901 from Bronchitis and
Asthma. She was 69 years old.
