<p>
After David's marriage to Frances Martha Clio Roberts he wanted to return to America as he could
see that there were good opportunities in that country. 
However Frances refused to go there. 
They therefore settled in the Leeds area.
</p>
 
<p>
When David's first child, Florence, was born on 31<sup>st</sup> January 1895 he and Frances were living at 
5 Highbury Lane, Headingley, Leeds and he was still working as a Domestic Gardener.
 
<p>
It is not known how long David continued as a gardener, but some time between that date and October 1896 
he changed his job and became the Golf Professional at Fulneck Golf Club and they moved to Fulneck, Pudsey.
</p>
 
<p>
In the 1890s there was a tremendous growth in the number of Golf Courses in the country and there was a 
consequential growth in the demand for golf professionals. 
Unlike today the main jobs of a golf professional were to repair the clubs of the members and to keep the
greens and tees in good shape, that is to be a greenkeeper. 
The latter was clearly a suitable job for a competent gardener.
</p>
 
<p>
Fulneck was an example of this golfing boom, having been founded in 1892. 
It was, and still is, a 9-hole course and is near Pudsey, Leeds.
</p>
 
<p>
In November 1897 the Ashburnham Golf Club at Burry Port, Camarthenshire, South Wales decided to
appoint their first professional. 
The Ashburnham Club is about 4 miles from Llanelli and, like Fulneck, was a 9-hole course. 
David Tate applied for the post and was appointed as professional and greenkeeper at a salary of 18
shillings <i>[90 pence]</i> a week. 
In addition he was allowed to charge 1 shilling <i>[5 pence]</i> instruction fee for every 9 holes 
he played with a member.
</p>

<p>
He took up his duties on 1<sup>st</sup> January 1898 and clearly created a great impression with the members 
because on 26th March the Club Committee increased his wages from 18 to 20 shillings.
</p>

<p>
In the same year the Club bought a ball making machine and in August 1899 the Committee agreed that the 
professional should have use of the machine free of charge - presumably he charged the members for 
any balls he made.
</p>

<p>
In 1902 it was decided to extend the course to 18 holes.
David Tate was instructed to lay out the new course and he quickly did so. 
The course he laid out was not too dissimilar to the present day course.
</p>

<p>
The first match was played over the new course in July of that year and the new lay-out was obviously 
to the liking of the club as they voted him a £5 bonus.
</p>

<p>
More detailed information on his days at Ashburnham are given on the page of this history dealing with 
Ashburnham Golf Club. 
This gives extracts from their Centenary book.
</p>

<p>
It was while he was at Ashburnham that his third child, Robert Frederick was born at 11 Carway Street, Pembrey.
</p>

<p>
On 18<sup>th</sup> February 1903 he left Ashburnham to become the professional at Radyr Golf Club, Cardiff, 
even though the Ashburnham club tried to get him to stay by offering him an increase of 
5 shillings<i>[25 pence]</i> a week.
</p>

<p>
Some time between 1903 and 1905 he again changed clubs and left Radyr to be the professional at
Morlais Castle Golf Club at Merthyr Tydfil which had been founded in 1900.
</p>

<p>
In early 1908 the Ashburnham Club again advertised for a professional and David Tate applied for it and was 
offered the post. 
This time, for some unknown reason, he withdrew his application.
</p>

<p>
When he went to Morlais Castle, the family settled in a &quot;two-up-and-two-down&quot; terrace house at 
38 Brynglas, Pen-y-darren, Merthyr Tydfil. 
Conditions in this two bedroomed house must have been crowded as the family had steadily grown and 
continued to do so. 
He was ultimately to have eight children.
</p>

<p>
The circumstances of the death of Robert Frederick his third child and second son were particularly tragic.
He died, killed in action in World War I, on 23<sup>rd</sup> October 1918. 
A letter, dated 9<sup>th</sup> November 1918, was sent by the War Office to his parents telling them of 
his death. 
This seems to have arrived on 12<sup>th</sup> November, the day after the Armistice had been signed and 
the war ended.
</p>

<p>
David Tate died at Brynglas on 23<sup>rd</sup> December 1943 at the age of 76. 
His Death Certificate records the cause of death as Influenza and broncho-pneumonia.
