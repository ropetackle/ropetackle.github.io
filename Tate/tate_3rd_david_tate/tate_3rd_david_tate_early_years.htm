<p>
David Tate was the seventh child of George Tate, a Farm Labourer, and Elizabeth Huggon.
</p>

<p>
He was born on 18<sup>th</sup> July 1867 in Cumberland, at Rickerby which is near Carlisle in the 
Parish of Stanwix.<br />
Rickerby is on the north bank of the River Eden, about <font size="1"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> </font>
mile east
of Carlisle and just off the A689. 
The village "belonged" to the MacInnes family who lived at Rickerby House. 
Descriptions of Rickerby, based on the 1881 Census Return and other documents, are given elsewhere in
this family history.
</p>

<p>
David had six brothers and three sisters. These were:-
</p>

<ul>
		<li>Thomas</li>
		<li>Betsy</li>
		<li>James</li>
		<li>George</li>
		<li>Mary</li>
		<li>Edward</li>
		<li>John</li>
		<li>Sarah</li>
		<li>Robert</li>
</ul>

<p>
The earliest reference to David is his Birth Certificate.
When he was born his father was working as a Farm Labourer.<br />
An interesting point is that on David's Birth Certificate there is a misspelling.
His father's surname is given as &quot;Tait&quot; not &quot;Tate&quot;.
</p>

<p>
When the 1871 Census was carried out David was 3 years old and living with his parents at Rickerby. 
His father was still a Farm Labourer.<br />
Also living with his parents were five of his brothers, Thomas, James, George, Edward and John and two
of his sisters, Betsy and Mary.
</p>
		
<p>
David is next mentioned in the 1881 Census.
He was now 13 years old, still at school and still living at Rickerby.<br />
Only four of his brothers were now still at home, George, Edward, John and Robert as well as his three 
sisters, Betsy, Mary, and Sarah.
</p>

<p>
When the 1891 Census was taken, David was still living with his parents at Rickerby together with two of 
his brothers, John and Robert, one sister, Mary and a 9 year old lodger, a schoolgirl called Rose Squires.
He was now 23 years old and working as a Gardener for the MacInnes family.<br />
According to the Census Return, which gives the address of the house simply as &quot;Cottage&quot; 
with no name or number, the house had 4 occupied rooms.
This house is shown in the photograph of the Tate's house taken in the 1980s and was probably the same one 
that they were occupying in 1881.
</p>
 
<p>
David seems to have been rather a rebellious and independent person. 
The MacInnes family were clearly a typical paternalistic, religious Victorian landowning family. 
All the servants, both indoor and outdoor, were required to attend daily morning and evening prayers in 
Rickerby House. 
He did not like this. 
Nor did he like the whole &quot;feudal&quot; atmosphere at Rickerby - the forelock tugging and 
general &quot;bowing and scraping&quot;.
</p>
 
<p>
David therefore decided, some time after April 1891, to leave and seek a better life in America. 
He went to the Boston area and worked as a nurseryman in the glasshouses there. 
Although he liked America he found that the humid atmosphere in the greenhouses affected him and after 
about a year he returned to England and in 1894 he was working as a Domestic Gardener at a house in 
Weetwood Lane, Headingley, Leeds.
