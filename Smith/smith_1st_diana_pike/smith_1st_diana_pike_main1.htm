<p>
Diana Pike was born in Cornwall, probably in
the Penryn Area, between 1815 and 1816. She was a daughter of 

<a href="../smith_a_thomas_pike/smith_a_thomas_pike_frame.htm"
title="Thomas Pike's Entry">
Thomas Pike</a>, a Tallow Chandler, and his wife 

<a href="../smith_a_elizabeth_pike/smith_a_elizabeth_pike_frame.htm"
title="Elizabeth Pike's Entry">
Elizabeth</a>.
</p>

<p>
Diana is thought to have had at least two sisters and one brother. These were:-
</p>

<blockquote>

<a href="../smith_1st_elizabeth_pike/smith_1st_elizabeth_pike_frame.htm"
title="Elizabeth Pike's Entry">
Elizabeth</a>, 

<a href="../smith_1st_ann_pike/smith_1st_ann_pike_frame.htm"
title="Ann Pike's Entry">
 Ann</a>, and

<a href="../smith_1st_thomas_pike/smith_1st_thomas_pike_frame.htm"
title="Thomas Pike's Entry">
Thomas</a>.
 </blockquote>

<p>
The only reference to Diana is in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1841_pike_penryn/1841_pike_penryn_main.htm#1diana"
target="_self" title="Ann Pike's Entry In 1841 Census">
1841 Census.</a>&nbsp; She was 25 years old and living with her mother and
father in the High Street, Penryn.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
The reasons for thinking that she was the sister of Elizabeth Pike are:-
</p>

<blockquote>
(1) Her mother was called Elizabeth<br />

(2) Her father's family were the only Pikes in Penryn in 1841 <br />

(3) The younger Elizabeth Pike was 40 when the 1841 Census was taken and this
would tie in with the age of Diana's sister Ann who was 30 when the Census was taken.<br />

(3) The husband of the younger Elizabeth, John Smith was a Tailor as was Diana's
brother Thomas.
