<p>
Thomas Pike was born in Cornwall, probably in
the Penryn Area, between 1815 and 1816. He was the son of 

<a href="../smith_a_thomas_pike/smith_a_thomas_pike_frame.htm"
title="Thomas Pike's Entry">
Thomas Pike</a>, a Tallow Chandler, and his wife 

<a href="../smith_a_elizabeth_pike/smith_a_elizabeth_pike_frame.htm"
title="Elizabeth Pike's Entry">
Elizabeth</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thomas is thought to have had at least three sisters. These were:-
</p>

<blockquote>

<a href="../smith_1st_elizabeth_pike/smith_1st_elizabeth_pike_frame.htm"
title="Elizabeth Pike's Entry">
Elizabeth</a>, 

<a href="../smith_1st_ann_pike/smith_1st_ann_pike_frame.htm"
title="Ann Pike's Entry">
 Ann</a>, and 

<a href="../smith_1st_diana_pike/smith_1st_diana_pike_frame.htm"
title="Diana Pike's Entry">
Diana</a>.
 </blockquote>

<p>
The only reference to Thomas is in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1841_pike_penryn/1841_pike_penryn_main.htm#1thomas"
target="_self" title="Thomas Pike's Entry In 1841 Census">
1841 Census.</a>&nbsp; He was 20 years old working as a Tailor and living with
his mother and
father in the High Street, Penryn.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
The reasons for thinking that he was the brother of Elizabeth Pike are:-
</p>

<blockquote>
(1) His mother was called Elizabeth<br />

(2) His father's family were the only Pikes in Penryn in 1841 <br />

(3) The younger Elizabeth Pike was 40 when the 1841 Census was taken and this
would tie in with the age of Thomas's sister Ann who was 30 when the Census was taken.<br />

(3) The husband of the younger Elizabeth, John Smith was a Tailor as was Thomas.
