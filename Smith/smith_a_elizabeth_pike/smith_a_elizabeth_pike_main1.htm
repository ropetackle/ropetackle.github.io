<p>
Elizabeth Pike, maiden name unknown, is thought to have been born in Cornwall in
the Penryn Area between
1775 and 1776. Nothing is known about her parents.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth married 

<a href="../smith_1st_thomas_pike/smith_1st_thomas_pike_frame.htm"
title="Thomas Pike's Entry">
Thomas Pike</a>, a Tallow Chandler. It is thought that Elizabeth was the Mother of 

<a href="../smith_1st_elizabeth_pike/smith_1st_elizabeth_pike_frame.htm"
title="Elizabeth Pike's Entry">
Elizabeth Pike</a> who was born in Penryn between 1799 and 1801. Elizabeth and Thomas had
at least three other children. These were:-
</p>

<blockquote>

<a href="../smith_1st_ann_pike/smith_1st_ann_pike_frame.htm"
title="Ann Pike's Entry">
Ann</a>, 

<a href="../smith_1st_diana_pike/smith_1st_diana_pike_frame.htm"
title="Diana Pike's Entry">
 Diana</a>, and

<a href="../smith_1st_thomas_pike/smith_1st_thomas_pike_frame.htm"
title="Thomas Pike's Entry">
Thomas</a>.
 </blockquote>

<p>
The only reference to Elizabeth is in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1841_pike_penryn/1841_pike_penryn_main.htm#aelizabeth"
target="_self" title="Elizabeth Pike's Entry In 1841 Census">
1841 Census.</a>&nbsp; She was 65 years old and living with her husband and
three of her children, Ann, Diana and Thomas, in the High Street, Penryn. The
Census Return gives her occupation as that of a Straw Bonnet Maker.
</p>

<p>
The reasons for thinking that she was the Mother of Elizabeth Pike are the fact
that:-
</p>

<blockquote>
(1) both of them are called Elizabeth<br />

(2) Elizabeth and Thomas Pike's family were the only Pikes in Penryn in 1841 <br />

(3) The younger Elizabeth Pike was 40 when the 1841 Census was taken and this
would tie in with the ages of Elizabeth's children as given in the 1841 Census,
Ann was 30, Diana 25 and Thomas 20<br />

(3) The husband of the younger Elizabeth, John Smith was a Tailor as was the
younger Thomas Pike.
