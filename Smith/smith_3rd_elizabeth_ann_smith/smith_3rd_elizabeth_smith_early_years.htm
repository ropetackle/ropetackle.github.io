<p>
Elizabeth Ann Smith is thought to have been born in Falmouth between 1870 and 1875.
She was a Daughter of Edward Thomas Smith, a Master Tailor, and his wife Elizabeth.<br />
The exact date of her birth in not clear.

the mother of Edward John Kingdon.

<p>
Elizabeth Ann was probably born in 1870 or 1871, although the exact date is not clear.
Her Marriage Certificate and the 1901 Census give her age as 26, which would mean that she was born in 
1874 or 1875.
However her Death Certificate her age when she died in 1929 as 58, which would mean that she was born in 
1870/71.
</p>

<p>
She had two sisters and two brothers. These were:-
</p>

<ul>
		<li>Edward John Thomas</li>
		<li>Emma Jane</li>
		<li>Harriet Katey</li>
		<li>Richard</li>
</ul>

<p>
According to Elizabeth Ann's niece, Olive Treloar,, the Smith family lived in Falmouth 
&quot;on the Terrace above Jacob’s Ladder&quot;.

Her parents later moved from Falmouth to Helston where her father was the  &quot;Headman&quot;
at Basil Thomas's, a Gentlemen's Outfitters in Coinage Hall Street.
</p>

<p>
DETAILS FORM 1881 CENSUS
</p>

<p>
The earliest reference to Elizabeth Ann is the 1901 Census.
This states that she was 26 years old and was living with her mother at 38 St Johns 
Street, Helston.
Her father had died some time between 1891 and 1901.<br />
The Census Return says that she was a Dress Maker working at home.
Her niece Olive Treloar says that E;izabeth was a Waist Coat Hand.
</p>

<p>
The death of Elizabeth Ann's father meant that the family were now no longer prosperous and her mother had to take in 
lodgers. 
One of these, James Kingdon who was a Railway Fireman employed by the Great Western Railway, was lodging with 
the Smith family when the 1901 Census was taken.
James married Elizabeth Ann later that year.
</p>

<hr class=bsfam />

<p>
Elizabeth Ann was clearly very fond of her brother Edward John Thomas, who was known as Jack, since she 
named her son 
Edward John after him and always referred to her son as Jack
</p>

<p>
According to her son, Elizabeth Ann had very little schooling and was unable to read or write. 
On her Marriage Certificate she did not sign her name but made her mark instead. 
She possibly suffered from what would now be called dyslexia as both her son and husband tried to teach
her to read and write but without success.<br />
However she was very practical and very good at crochet needlework. 
Unfortunately, when she died, her son was not then sufficiently interested to keep any of her needlework and 
none of it survives.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth Ann had been a delicate child and had suffered badly from smallpox.
Her face was pock marked by the smallpox scars and the effects of unhygienic vaccination. 
According to her son she was very self conscious about this and usually wore a veil when going out.
The pock marks are not noticeable, except on the neck, in the photo of her which was taken between 
1900 and 1910.
</p>

<p>
Further information about her is given in the entry for 4th April 1980 in the diary of her son.
</p>

<p>
A letter sent in 1977 by her niece, Olive Treloar, to Edward John Kingdon contains amusing and interesting 
information on Elizabeth’s parents and her family and on events in Falmouth when they lived there towards 
the end of the C19th.
