Some time after after Elizabeth Ann Smith married James Kingdon in 1901 they moved to Plymouth.
When her son, Edward John was born on 22nd September 1906 they were living at 
25 Holdsworth Street, Plymouth in the area known as Pennycomequick. 
This is the area of Plymouth immediately to the north of the Railway Station and the house was within 
walking distance of the Railway Station.

<p>
In 1907 Elizabeth and her family moved to Princetown, on Dartmoor. 
There they lived in a house in a terrace of three belonging to the Great Western Railway.
The terrace, which still exists, is now known as the Old Station Cottages, Station Road, Princetown.
</p>

<p>
From Princetown they moved to Newton Abbott, Devon where they lived at 4 Powderham Terrace. 
When they moved is not known but the family were there by 1910 or 1911.
</p>

<p>
The house at Powderham Terrace was up a very steep hill and was most unsuitable for Elizabeth Ann as she had 
heart problems. 
This meant that she was virtually confined to the house and her son had to do all the shopping for her.
</p>

<p>
She died at 4 Powderham Terrace on 8th July 1929, aged 58.
</p>

<p>
Further information about her is given in the entry for 4th April 1980 in the diary of her son.
