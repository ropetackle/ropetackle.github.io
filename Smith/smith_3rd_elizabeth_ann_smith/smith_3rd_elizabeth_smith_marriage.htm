<p>
When the 1901 Census was taken in March of that year, Elizabeth Ann Smith was 26 and living with her 
mother at 38 St Johns Road, Helston.
Also living with them was James Kingdon, a 19 year old lodger who was a Railway Fireman with the 
Great Western Railway.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth Ann and James were married later that year, on 5th September 1901, at Helston Parish Church.
The witnesses to their marriage were her brother and sister, Edward John Thomas Smith and Katey Smith.<br >
It is interesting to note that James lied about his age. Although according to the Census Return he was 19, when he married he gave his age as 22.
It is thought that the reason for this was that by declaring that he was over 21 years old he would not 
have had to obtain his parents' permission to marry.<br />
It is also interesting to note that Elizabeth Ann did not sign the Marriage Register, she 
&quot; made her mark &quot; with an <b>X</b>.
</p>

<p>
Some time after their marriage Elizabeth Ann and James moved to Plymouth.
When her son, Edward John&nbsp; was born on 22nd September 1906 they were living at 
25 Holdsworth Street, Plymouth in the area known as Pennycomequick. 
This is the area of Plymouth immediately to the north of the Railway Station and the house was within 
walking distance of the Station.
</p>

<p>
Further information about her is given in the entry for 4th April 1980 in the diary of her son.
