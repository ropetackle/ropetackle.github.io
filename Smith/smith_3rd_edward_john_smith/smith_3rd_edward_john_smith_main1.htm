<p>
Edward John Thomas Smith was born in Falmouth between 1868 and 1871.
He was a son of Edward Thomas Smith, a Master Tailor, and his wife Elizabeth
Smith.
</p>

<p>
He had three sisters and one brother. These were:-
</p>

<ul>
		<li>Elizabeth Ann</li>
		<li>Richard</li>
		<li>Emma Jane</li>
		<li>Harriet Katey</li>
</ul>

<hr class=bnonfam />

<p>
Edward John Thomas was always known as Jack.
He was the favourite brother of his sister Elizabeth Ann and this is why her son was
named Edward John but was always called Jack.
</p>

<p>
According to his niece Olive Treloar, the Smith family lived in Falmouth 
&quot;on the Terrace above Jacob’s Ladder&quot;.
His parents later moved from Falmouth to Helston where his father was the  &quot;Headman&quot;
at Basil Thomas's, a Gentlemen's Outfitters in Coinage Hall Street.
</p>

<p>
DETAILS FROM 1881 CENSUS
</p>

<p>
The only reference to him is in on the Marriage Certificate of his sister Elizabeth Ann where his was one 
of the witnesses. 
</p>

<p>
He was a Petty Officer in the Royal Navy and was drowned at sea.
It isn't known when or how he died.
</p>

<p>
Most of the above information about him is taken from a letter sent by Olive Treloar to her cousin
Edward John Kingdon in 1977.
The letter also contains some amusing and interesting information on the Smith family and life in 
Falmouth towards the end of the C19th.
