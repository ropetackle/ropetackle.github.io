<p>
Thomas Pike is thought to have been born in Cornwall in
the Penryn Area between
1775 and 1776. Nothing is known about his parents.
</p>

<p>
Thomas married 

<a href="../smith_a_elizabeth_pike/smith_a_elizabeth_pike_frame.htm"
title="Elizabeth Pike's Entry">
Elizabeth</a> (maiden name unknown). It is thought that Thomas was the Father of 

<a href="../smith_1st_elizabeth_pike/smith_1st_elizabeth_pike_frame.htm"
title="Elizabeth Pike's Entry">
Elizabeth Pike</a> who was born in Penryn between 1799 and 1801. Thomas and
Elizabeth had
at least three other children. These were:-
</p>

<blockquote>

<a href="../smith_1st_ann_pike/smith_1st_ann_pike_frame.htm"
title="Ann Pike's Entry">
Ann</a>, 

<a href="../smith_1st_diana_pike/smith_1st_diana_pike_frame.htm"
title="Diana Pike's Entry">
 Diana</a>, and

<a href="../smith_1st_thomas_pike/smith_1st_thomas_pike_frame.htm"
title="Thomas Pike's Entry">
Thomas</a>.
 </blockquote>

<p>
The only reference to Thomas is in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1841_pike_penryn/1841_pike_penryn_main.htm#athomas"
target="_self" title="Thomas Pike's Entry In 1841 Census">
1841 Census.</a>&nbsp; He was 65 years old and living with his wife and
three of their children, Ann, Diana and Thomas, in the High Street, Penryn. The
Census Return gives his occupation as that of a Tallow Chandler.
</p>

<p>
The reasons for thinking that hr was the Father of Elizabeth Pike are the fact
that:-
</p>

<blockquote>
(1) His wife was called Elizabeth<br />

(2) Thomas and Elizabeth's family were the only Pikes in Penryn in 1841 <br />

(3) The younger Elizabeth Pike was 40 when the 1841 Census was taken and this
would tie in with the ages of Thomas's children as given in the 1841 Census,
Ann was 30, Diana 25 and Thomas 20<br />

(3) The husband of the younger Elizabeth, John Smith was a Tailor as was the
younger Thomas Pike.
