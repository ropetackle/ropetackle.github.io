<p>
Emma Jane Smith was born in Falmouth, Cornwall on 13<sup>th</sup> October 1871.
She was the youngest daughter of Edward Thomas Smith, a Master Tailor and his wife Elizabeth.
</p>

<p>
She had two sisters and two brothers. These were:-
</p>

<ul>
		<li>Elizabeth Ann</li>
		<li>Richard</li>
		<li>Edward John Thomas</li>
		<li>Harriet Katey</li>
</ul>

<p>
Emma married Alfred Treloar at Helston on 4<sup>th</sup> February 1901 and they had two children.
These were:-
</p>

<ul>
		<li>Olive</li>
		<li> Norman</li>
</ul>

<p>
She died at Higher Bodilly, Wendron, near Helston on 9<sup>th</sup> May 1929.
</p>

<hr class=bnonfam />

<p>
According to her daughter Olive, the Smith family lived in Falmouth 
&quot;on the Terrace above Jacob’s Ladder&quot;.

Her parents later moved from Falmouth to Helston where her father was the  &quot;Headman&quot;
at Basil Thomas's, a Gentlemen's Outfitters in Coinage Hall Street.
</p>

<p>
DETAILS FROM 1881 CENSUS
</p>

<p>
The first reference to Emma is in the 1891 Census.
She was 22 years old and living with her parents and her brother Richard and sister Harriet Katey in 
Meneage Street, Helston.<br />
The Census Return says that she was a Tailoress but according to her daughter Olive it would be more 
accurate to describe her as a Waist Coat Hand.
</p>

<p>
Emma married Alfred Treloar at Helston on 4<sup>th</sup> February 1901.
Alfred, who was born at Helston on 20<sup>th</sup> January 1866, was a member of an old Helston family.
He was a miner and spent at least 20 years in the goldfields of South Africa, Australia and America.
When he needed money he would go out to the goldfields to work.
When enough had been saved he would return to his family in Helston and stay there until the money had run 
out and then go abroad again.
</p>

<p>
She died at Higher Bodilly, Wendron, which is about 2 miles north of Helston on the B3297, on 9<sup>th</sup> 
May 1929.
Her husband also died at Higher Bodilly, on 6<sup>th</sup> October 1932.
</p>

<p>
Most of the above information about her is taken from a letter sent by Olive Treloar to her cousin
Edward John Kingdon in 1977.
The letter also contains some amusing and interesting information on the Smith family and life in 
Falmouth towards the end of the C19th.
