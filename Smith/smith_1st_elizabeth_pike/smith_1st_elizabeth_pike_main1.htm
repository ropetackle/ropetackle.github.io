<p>
Elizabeth Pike was born in Penryn, Cornwall between 1799 and
1801. 
She is thought to have been a daughter of 

<a href="../smith_a_thomas_pike/smith_a_thomas_pike_frame.htm"
title="Thomas Pike's Entry">
 Thomas Pike</a>, a Tallow Chandler,
and his wife 

<a href="../smith_a_elizabeth_pike/smith_a_elizabeth_pike_frame.htm"
title="Elizabeth Pike's Entry">
Elizabeth</a>, a Straw Bonnet Maker.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth is thought to have had at least two sisters and a brother.
These were:
</p>

<blockquote>

<a href="../smith_1st_ann_pike/smith_1st_ann_pike_frame.htm"
title="Ann Pike's Entry">
Ann</a>, 

<a href="../smith_1st_diana_pike/smith_1st_diana_pike_frame.htm"
title="Diana Pike's Entry">
 Diana</a> and 

<a href="../smith_1st_thomas_pike/smith_1st_thomas_pike_frame.htm"
title="Thomas Pike's Entry">
 Thomas</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Elizabeth married <a href="../smith_1st_john_smith/smith_1st_john_smith_frame.htm"
title="John Smith's Entry">
John Smith</a>, a tailor and they had at least three children. These were:-
</p>

<blockquote>

<a href="../../Smith/smith_2nd_harriett_smith/smith_2nd_harriett_smith_frame.htm"
title="Harriett Smith's Entry">
Harriett</a>, 

<a href="../smith_2nd_edward_smith/smith_2nd_edward_smith_frame.htm"
title="Edward Thomas Smith's Entry">
 Edward Thomas</a> and 

<a href="../smith_2nd_john_smith/smith_2nd_john_smith_frame.htm"
title="John Smith's Entry">
John</a>.
 </blockquote>

<p>
The reasons for thinking that Elizabeth was the daughter of Thomas and Elizabeth
Pike are:
</p>

<blockquote>
(1) Both she and Thomas Pike's wife were called Elizabeth<br />
(2) Thomas Pike's family were the only Pikes in Penryn in 1841<br />
(3) Elizabeth was 40 when the 1841 Census was taken and this
would tie in with the ages of&nbsp; Thomas and his wife who were both 65 years
old at that time, and the ages of their children - Ann 30, Diana 25 and Thomas
20.<br />
(3) Elizabeth's husband, John Smith, was a Tailor as was the son of Thomas and
Elizabeth. It is possible that John and Thomas either worked together or Thomas
had been John's Apprentice and this was how she met John.
</blockquote>

<p>
The first reference to Elizabeth is in the

Elizabeth was still living in Wendron Street
