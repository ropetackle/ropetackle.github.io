<p>
Edward John Kingdon, known as Jack, was the only child of 

<a href="../kingdon_3rd_james_kingdon/kingdon_3rd_james_kingdon_frame.htm"
title="James Kingdon's Entry">
 James Kingdon</a>, a Fireman with the Great Western Railway, and 

<a
href="../../Smith/smith_3rd_elizabeth_ann_smith/smith_3rd_elizabeth_smith_frame.htm"
title="Elizabeth Ann Smith's Entry">
 Elizabeth Ann Smith</a>. He was named after his mother's favourite brother,
Edward John Thomas Smith, who was always known as Jack. He was born on 

<a

target="_self" title="Copy Of Jack Kingdon's Birth Certificate">
 22<sup>nd</sup> September 1906</a> at 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/holdsworth_street/holdsworth_street_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Map Showing Holdsworth Street">
 25 Holdsworth Street</a>, Plymouth
in the area known as 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/pennycomequick/pennycomequick_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Map Showing Pennycomequick">
Pennycomequick</a>. The house was just to the north of Plymouth
Railway Station and therefore convenient for his father to get to work.
</p>

<p>
In 1907 the family moved from Plymouth to 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/princetown/princetown_main.htm" target="_self"
title="Map Showing Princetown">
 Princetown</a> on Dartmoor.
</p>

<p>
Although there is now no station at Princetown, the house they lived in is still
there. It was one of a terrace of three houses, now known as the 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/station_cottages/station_cottages_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Map Showing old Station Cottages">
 Old Station Cottages</a>, in Station Road. 
 The railway from Plymouth to Princetown had been
opened in 1883 and the Cottages and neighbouring Station Master's house had been
built by the Great Western Railway at about the same time.
</p>

<p>
The family lived in Princetown for 2 or 3 years and then, some time before 1910
or 1911, they moved to 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/newton_abbott/newton_abbott_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Map Showing Newton Abbott">
 Newton Abbott</a>,
Devon where they lived at 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/powderham_terrace/powderham_terrace_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Map Showing Powderham Terrace">
 4 Powderham Terrace</a>. 
 The house at Powderham Terrace is
up a very steep hill and because his mother suffered from heart trouble and
rarely if ever left the house, Jack had to do all the shopping for her.
</p>

<p>
Jack first went to the local school at Decoy, an area of Newton Abbott, and from
there he won a Scholarship to the Grammar School in Newton Abbott. An account of
his 

<a
href="../../Documents/Kingdon/edward_kingdon_childhood/edward_kingdon_childhood_main1.htm"
target="_self" title="Extracts From Jack Kingdon's diary About His Childhood">
childhood and schooldays</a> at Newton Abbott is given in an extract from his
diary.
</p>

<p>
From the Grammar School he went to St Luke’s College Exeter to train to be a teacher.
It was while he was at St Luke's that he met 

<a href="../../Tate/tate_4th_marjorie_tate/tate_4th_marjorie_tate_frame.htm"
title="Marjorie Tate's Entry">
 Marjorie Tate</a>.
Apparently when Marjorie first met him he had very recently hurt his leg playing 
football and was therefore limping badly. 
She thought he was crippled!
</p>

<p>
In 1928, after graduating, he started teaching at Grafton Road Mixed School, Dagenham and when 
Marjorie also qualified as a teacher she followed him to Dagenham.<br />
Dagenham, which was built as part of a big slum clearance project to provide
decent, modern housing for the people of the East End of London, was still being
built when he started work there. In his first term at the school he had 60
children in his class, which was housed in a wooden hut. When the main school
building was completed his class size was reduced to 40! The following year it
became a senior boys’ school, Grafton Senior School.
</p>

<p>
Jack and Marjorie

married</a> in 1930.
</p>

<p>
During the period from October 1978 to October 1982 he wrote a 

<a
href="../../Documents/Kingdon/edward_kingdon_diary/edward_kingdon_diary_1978/edward_kingdon_diary_1978_frame.htm">
diary</a>. As well as
covering everyday events at Bourton on the Water and at Ilkley during that
period, the diary also contains many reminiscences of his childhood and his
parents. It also contains an interesting account of his views on literacy in
Victorian times and his experiences in teaching children to read.
