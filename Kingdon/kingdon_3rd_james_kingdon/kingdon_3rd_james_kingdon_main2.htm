James and

 Elizabeth Ann Smith</a> married at Helston Parish Church on

 5th September 1901</a>.<br />

The Marriage Certificate is interesting. When James married he was only 19 and
not of &quot;full age&quot;. In England in those days you could not legally
marry without your parent's consent if you were under 21. James clearly didn't
want to try and get parental permission and therefore lied about his age, giving his age as 22.
Also on the Marriage Certificate, the space for his father's name is blank.
</p>

<p>
It isn't known whether James and Elizabeth remained in Helston after they married or,
if they did, how long they stayed there.
</p>

<p>
However when their son

 22<sup>nd</sup>
September 1906</a>, James and Elizabeth had moved to Plymouth. They were living at

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/holdsworth_street/holdsworth_street_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Map Showing Holdsworth Street">
25 Holdsworth Street</a> in an area known as 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/pennycomequick/pennycomequick_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Map Showing Pennycomequick">
Pennycomequick</a>. this lies just to the North of the Railway Station and the house would
have been very convenient for him to get to work. James was still employed as a
Fireman on the Great Western Railway.
</p>

<p>
In 1907 James moved from Plymouth to 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/princetown/princetown_main.htm" target="_self"
title="Map Showing Princetown">
 Princetown</a> on Dartmoor.
</p>

<p>
Although there is now no station at Princetown, the house they lived in is still
there. It was one of a terrace of three houses, now known as the 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/station_cottages/station_cottages_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Map Showing Old Station Cottages">
 Old Station Cottages</a>, in Station Road. The railway from Plymouth to Princetown had been
opened in 1883 and the Cottages and neighbouring Station Master's house had been
built by the Great Western Railway at about the same time.
</p>

<p>
James and his family lived in Princetown for 2 or 3 years and then, some time
before 1910 or 1911, they moved to 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/newton_abbott/newton_abbott_main.htm"
target="_self">
 Newton Abbott</a>, Devon where they lived at 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/powderham_terrace/powderham_terrace_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Map Showing Powderham Terrace">
 4 Powderham Terrace</a>. James was
still living at Powderham Terrace when Elizabeth Ann died in 1929.
</p>

<p>
Newton Abbott was an important station on the main Great Western Railway from
Cornwall to London. Whether James moved there on promotion to Engine Driver isn't
known but it seems possible. However he did become a driver and eventual was a driver on the Great
Western Railway's most prestigious train, the Cornish Riviera Express, which ran
to London.
</p>

<p>
After Elizabeth Ann died James married his cousin Lillie.
</p>

<p>
When James retired from the railway he went to live in Bristol. He was living in
Bristol, at
