<p>
James Kingdon was born in 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/south_molton/south_molton_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Map Showing South Molton">
South Molton</a>, Devon in August 1881.&nbsp; He was illegitimate and was the first child of 

<a href="../kingdon_2nd_susanna_kingdon/kingdon_2nd_susanna_kingdon_frame.htm"
title="Susanna Kingdon's Entry">
 Susanna Kingdon</a>, a General Servant. His father is unknown.
</p>

<p>
In 1883 his mother married 

<a href="../kingdon_2nd_john_ford/kingdon_2nd_john_ford_frame.htm"
title="John Ford's Entry">
 John Ford</a>, a Gardener , but James
never took his stepfather’s name, keeping his mother’s maiden name of
Kingdon.
</p>

<p>
James had at least 3 stepbrothers and 8 stepsisters. These were:-

<p>
When James was born it is thought that his Mother and 

<a href="../kingdon_1st_james_kingdon/kingdon_1st_james_kingdon_frame.htm"
title=" James Kingdon's Entry">
Grandfather</a> were living at 2 Bennetts Court, South Molton as that is where
they were living when the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1881_kingdon_smolton/1881_kingdon_smolton_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Kingdon 1881 Census Entry">
1881 Census</a> was taken. Bennetts Court may have been in 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/east_street/east_street_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Map Showing East Street, South Molton">
 East Street.</a>
</p>

<p>
After his mother's marriage she and her husband&nbsp; lived for a time at 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/south_molton/south_molton_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Map Showing Romansleigh">
Romansleigh</a>, Devon but by
1885 or 1886 they had moved to 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/copplestone/copplestone_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Map Showing Morchard Bishop">
 Morchard Bishop</a>, Devon.
</p>

<p>
The earliest reference to James is in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1891_kingdon_morchard_bishop/1891_kingdon_morchard_bishop_main.htm#3james"
title="James Kingdon's Entry In 1891 Census" target="_self">
 1891 Census</a>. He was 9 years old and
living with his mother and stepfather and their four eldest children
in the Parish of Morchard Bishop where his stepfather was working as an
Agricultural Labourer. The Census gives their address as 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/watcombe/watcombe_main.htm" target="_self"
title="Map Showing Watcombe">
Watcombe</a>. This could
have been a farm near the hamlet of Knightstone or Farthing Park which are about
2 kilometers east of Morchard Bishop. He is described as a Scholar which would indicate that he
was still at school.
</p>

<p>
In late 1891 or 1892 the family moved to the Parish of 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/copplestone/copplestone_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Map Showing Colebrooke">
Colebrooke</a>, Devon. It is almost certain
that they were living in&nbsp; 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/copplestone/copplestone_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Map Showing Copplestone">
Copplestone</a>, which is in the Parish of Colebrooke.
What is known is that, although James had left home, the rest of the family were
living at 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/furzedown/furzedown_main.htm" target="_self"
title="Map Showing Furzedown Cottages, Copplestone">
 1 Furzedown Cottages,</a> Copplestone when the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1901_ford_copplestone/1901_ford_copplestone_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Extract From 1901 Census For Copplestone">
 1901 Census</a> was taken.
</p>

<p>
James left school to start work as a Farm Labourer &quot;well before I was
ten&quot;. As his birthday was in August this probably means that he left school
at Easter 1882 - Easter being the start of the busy season on a farm.
</p>

<p>
James could clearly see that there was no future in being a Farm Labourer and
when he was16 he left home and joined the Great
Western Railway at Exeter as a Cleaner.<br />
A Cleaner was the lowest grade of footplate man on the railways. His main job
was to clean the engine, rake out the firebox, i.e. remove the ashes, and
prepare the engine, for example lighting the fire, ready for the fireman and
driver when they reported for duty. Although it sounds like a menial job it
was in fact the first stage of an apprenticeship which led to person becoming first a
Locomotive Fireman and finally a Driver. In those days all Engine Drivers
started their careers as Cleaners.
</p>

<p>
From Exeter James moved to Helston where he lodged with 

<a
href="../../Smith/smith_3rd_elizabeth_ann_smith/smith_3rd_elizabeth_smith_frame.htm"
title="Elizabeth Ann Smith's Entry">
 Elizabeth Ann Smith's</a>
family in St John's Road, Helston. He was living with them when the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1901_smith_helston/1901_smith_helston_main.htm#3james"
target="_self" title="James Kingdon's Entry In 1901 Census">
 1901 Census</a> was taken.
It seems most likely that he moved to Helston on promotion to Fireman, as that is
the occupation he gives on the Census Return. The Census gives his age as
19.
</p>

<p>
Later that year James and Elizabeth Ann
