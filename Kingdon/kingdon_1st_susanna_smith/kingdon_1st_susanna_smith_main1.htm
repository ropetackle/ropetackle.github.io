title="Map Showing South Molton" target="_self">
South Molton</a> area of Devon.
 Nothing is known about when she was born. Neither is anything known about her
parents.
 </p>
 
 <p>
Susanna married 

<a href="../kingdon_1st_james_kingdon/kingdon_1st_james_kingdon_frame.htm"
title="James Kingdon's Entry">
James Kingdon</a>, a Farm Labourer, and they had at least 2 children,

The only reference to Susanna is in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Birth%20Certificates/1862_susanna_kingdon/1862_susanna_kingdon_bc_main.htm"
title="Copy Of Susanna Kingdon's Birth Certificate" target="_self">
 Birth Certificate</a> of her daughter Susanna who was born
on 20<sup>th</sup> November 1862. She was living in 

<a href="../../maps/kingdon_maps/east_street/east_street_main.htm"
target="_self" title="Map Showing East Street, South Molton">
 East Street</a>, 

 South Molton, Devon.
When she registered the birth she signed the Register with an &quot;<b>X</b>&quot;.
</p>

<p>
She appears to died some time between 1870 or 1871, when&nbsp; her daughter Jane
was born, and 1881 as the Census of that year describes her husband as a Widower.
She may have died at South Molton in 1878 (Death Register to check - vol 5b,
page 377, March 1878)
