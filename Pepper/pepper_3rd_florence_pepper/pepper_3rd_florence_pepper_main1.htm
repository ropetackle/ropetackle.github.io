<p>
Florence had two sisters and one brother. These were:-

</blockquote>

<p>
The earliest reference to Florence is her
 Birth Certificate. When she was born her father was about 40 years old and worked as a Labourer in the Provinder Stores of the Midland 
Railway Company.
Her mother was about 33.<br />
When she was born her parents already had two children, Alice Mary and Eliza.
</p>
<p>
The next mention of Florence is in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1881_pepper_nottingham/1881_pepper_nottingham_main.htm#3florence"
target="main" title="Florence's Entry In 1881 Census">
 1881 Census</a>.
She was 2 years old and her family were still living at 25 Newbridge Street. 
Her father was aged 42 and described as a Railway Labourer while her mother was 35 and worked 
as a Maker Up at a Hosiery Works.
</p>

<p>
Ten years later, when the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1891_pepper_nottingham/1891_pepper_nottingham_main.htm#3florence"
target="main" title="Florence's Entry In 1891 Census">
 1891 Census</a> was taken there had been considerable changes in the
family circumstances.
The family were still living at 25 Newbridge Street but there was now a younger brother, Robert John Henry, 
who was only 9 years old. 
More importantly her father had died in December 1882.<br />
Florence was only 12 years old but had already left school to earn a living and was working as an Errand Girl
to help support the family.
</p>

<p>
Life must have been hard for her mother and the family without the income of Florence's father, 
particularly as her second sister, Eliza, who was now 16, was, according to the Census Return 
still at school.<br />
According to Florence's daughter-in-law, Peggy Davies, Florence had told her that Eliza had 
suffered some form of brain damage as a child and was not capable of earning a living.<br />
The only income the family had was that which her mother Annie and eldest sister Alice 
earned from their work as Hosiery Menders and that which Florence brought in as 12 year old Errand Girl.
None of this work would have been well paid.
</p>

<p>
When the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1901_pepper_nottingham/1901_pepper_nottingham_main.htm#3florence"
target="main" title="Florence's Entry In 1901 Census">
 1901 Census</a> was taken there had been further changes in the family.
Florence's mother seems to have died.
The Census shows that Alice had married a John Thomas Prior, a Self-Employed Undertaker and Joiner, and 
Florence, Eliza and Robert were living with them at 12 Newthorpe Street, Nottingham.
Florence was 22 years old and working as a Hosiery Mender.
</p>

<p>
It was while she was living there that, in 1909, she met Sergeant 

<a
href="../../Marshall/marshall_3rd_thomas_marshall/marshall_3rd_thomas_marshall_frame.htm"
title="Thomas Marshall's Entry">
 Thomas Marshall</a> of the 1<sup>st</sup> 
Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers who had arrived home on leave from India in
March of that year and was staying nearby with his
parents or relatives.
</p>

<p>
By the time Thomas and the Battalion returned to overseas service in the October
of 1909 he and Florence were engaged.
