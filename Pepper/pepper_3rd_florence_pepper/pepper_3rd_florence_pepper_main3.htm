When Florence's husband

title="Thomas Marshall's Entry">
Thomas</a> left the Army in 1922 it was not a particularly good time to be
looking for employment, especially in Glasgow. It was the height of the
Depression and the level of unemployment was high. He and
 Florence had thought of
getting work as the Steward and Stewardess at a club somewhere but this did not come about.
</p>

<p>
The only employment that Thomas seems to have found was that of a Commissionaire under the auspices of
the Royal Corps Of Commissionaires. This organisation found work for former Non Commissioned
Officers as Doormen, Receptionists and Night Watchmen at Offices and other commercial premises.
It was not well paid and Florence had to go out to work. What she did is not
known although she certainly worked for a period as a cook in a canteen.

</p>

<p>
After Thomas died in 1941 Florence continued to live in Glasgow. However when
her son and his family moved to

</p>

<p>
This arrangement was not satisfactory and eventually, in the early 1960s, it became
so unbearable
for Tommy's wife Peggy that Florence went to live at an Old People's Residential Home
at Moss Bank, St Helens. She was living there when she died on 19<sup>th</sup>
August 1966 aged 87. Her
