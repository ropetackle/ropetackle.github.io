By the time that 

<a

title="Thomas Marshall's Entry">
 Thomas Marshall</a> and the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers left
Britain on the 7<sup>th</sup> October 1909 for the Andaman Islands Florence and Thomas were engaged.

<p>
Immediately on arriving in the Andaman Islands Thomas must have started to take steps to arrange for his 
marriage to Florence, since, on the 20th July 1910, she received a 

<a href="../../Documents/Pepper/army_letters_main1.htm" target="main"
title="Letter 1 from Army">
 letter</a> from a Major Caird at the 
Infantry Records Office, Hamilton, Scotland.<br />
This letter said that an application had been received from the Commanding Officer, 1st Battalion, 
Royal Scots Fusiliers, requesting an Indulgence Passage for her to go to South Africa 
(the Battalion having moved to that country in the meantime) to marry Sergeant T Marshall.
</p>

<p>
Further correspondence, (

<a href="../../Documents/Pepper/army_letters_main4.htm" target="main"
title="Letter 4 from Army">
letter 4</a>) took place between the Infantry Records Office and Florence 
with the result that, on the 20th December 1910, she embarked at Southampton on the Transport Ship “Soudan” 
for Durban, South Africa.
</p>

<p>
When you think of the length of notice that would be expected nowadays if you were 
moving overseas, it is interesting to see how different it was then.
On the 20th July the first letter was sent. 
This told her that the request for a passage had been received. 
On the 10th December a letter was sent informing her that she would be sailing from Southampton 10 days later!
</p>

<p>
Florence arrived in Durban in January 1911 and they were married there by licence on the

<a
href="../../Documents/Marriage%20Certificates/1911_pepper_marshall/1911_pepper_marshall_mc_main.htm"
target="main" title="Copy Of Florence's Marriage Certificate">
 16th January</a>. 
According to her son it was a requirement of the Army that, if a woman was allowed an 
Indulgence Passage overseas to marry a soldier, then the marriage had to take place immediately she landed 
in the country.
Clearly the Army did not want any unattached white women providing possible temptations for their soldiers!
This was why Florence and Thomas were married in Durban although he was stationed at 
Pretoria, about 530 kilometres away.

Nine months later, on the

 26th November</a> he was baptized at the Garrison Church there.
The Battalion Orders issued on the 21st October 1911 also record her son's birth.
</p>

<p>
Life in the Army in South Africa must have been a huge contrast for Florence. As
the wife of a sergeant she was able to lead a comfortable life, far removed from
the poverty of her life in Nottingham. The Army was a very hierarchical society,
a wife &quot;took&quot; the rank of her husband. - a wife of a sergeant only
associated with the wives of other sergeants. The Colonel's wife was the Senior
Wife, the Officer-In Command of all wives in the Regiment. As a sergeant's wife,
Florence&nbsp; was supposed to take responsibility for the wives of ordinary
soldiers, particularly for the wives of those who served under her husband,
making sure that they did not behave incorrectly and also acting as their
Welfare Officer. Conversely she was under the &quot;command&quot; of the wives
of Warrant Officers and Officers. If her husband was promoted a wife was also
&quot;promoted&quot; - she moved up a class and was not expected to associate
with wives of those in his previous rank.
</p>

<p>
Florence's comfortable life in South Africa came to an end in February 1914. In
that month, presumably because of the worsening situation in Europe, the
Battalion returned to England.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
On the 14<sup>th</sup> August 1914 Florence's life underwent a further dramatic
change when her husband embarked for France as part of the&nbsp; British
Expeditionary Force, war on Germany having been declared ten days earlier. World
War I had started. She had no way of knowing whether she and her son would ever
see Thomas again.
</p>

<p>
Where she lived during the war is not known, although at some stage she and
Tommy were living with her brother-in-law, George Marshall, in Nottingham.
</p>

<p>
When the Battalion returned from Europe in 1919 it went to Bordon Camp,
Hampshire and Florence and her family lived there in Married Quarters. It is
assumed that they continued to live there until the Battalion moved to Glasgow
in April 1922. Certainly they were living in Glasgow when Thomas left the Army
after 21 years service.
