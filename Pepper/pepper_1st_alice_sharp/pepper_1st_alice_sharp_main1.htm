<p>
Alice Sharp was born between 1814 and 1816 at Barton, Leicestershire.
There doesn't appear to be any place just called Barton in Leicestershire but there is a

<a href="../../maps/pepper_maps/swepstone_location/swepstone_location_main.htm"
target="main" title="Map Showing Barton In The Beans">
 Barton In The Beans</a>
which is about 5 kilometres from Swepstone.
This could quite well have been her birth place.<br />
Nothing is known about her parents.

<p>
She married 

<a href="../pepper_1st_thomas_pepper/pepper_1st_thomas_pepper_frame.htm"

 Thomas Pepper</a>, an Agricultural Labourer and they had at least 7 children.
These were:-

The first reference to Alice is on the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Birth%20Certificates/1839_robert_pepper/1839_robert_pepper_bc_main.htm"
target="main" title="Copy Of Robert Pepper's Birth Certificate">
 Birth Certificate</a> of her son Robert who was born in February 1839.
According to the Birth Certificate she and her family were living at Newton Nethercote in the Parish of Swepstone, Leicestershire.
Swepstone lies roughly half way between Measham, which is just off the A42 south of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and 
Ibstock, which is on the A447.
<br />
The current Ordinance Survey map for Swepstone does not show any place called Newton Nethercote. 
There is a village called Newton Burgoland and a Nethercote Farm. 
Both of these are in the parish of Swepstone and about 1 km away. 
As Thomas was an Agricultural Labourer it is possible that they were actually living at

 Nethercote Farm</a>.
</p>

<p>
Alice is next mentioned in the 

<a

target="main" title="Alice's 1841 Census Entry">
 1841 Census</a>.
She was then 25 years old and living with Thomas and their 4 children, Fanny, 
William, Robert and Elizabeth, at

title="Map Showing Dishley Farm">
 Dishley</a> in the Parish of Swepstone, Leicestershire.<br />

<a
href="../../Places%20&amp;%20Buildings/dishley_farm_swepstone/dishley_farm_main.htm"
target="main" title="Photo Of Dishley Farm">
Dishley Farm</a> is about 1km. from Swepstone and it is assumed that her husband was working at that 
farm at the time.
</p> 

<p>
When Alice's daughter Esther was born in February 1843 the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Birth%20Certificates/1843_esther_pepper/1843_esther_pepper_bc_main.htm"
target="main" title="Copy Of Esther Pepper's Birth Certificate">
 Birth Certificate</a> records
the place of birth as simply 
Swepstone.
</p> 

<p>
When Alice registered the births of both Robert and Esther she did not sign the Registers.
She simply made her mark with an <b>X</b>. 
It is therefore assumed that she could not write.
</p>

<p>
When the

 1851 Census</a> was taken Alice was 36 years old and still living in Swepstone village.
Two of her children, Fanny and William, had left home.
