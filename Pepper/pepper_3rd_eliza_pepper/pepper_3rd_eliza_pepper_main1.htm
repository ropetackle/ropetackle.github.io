Eliza A (Ann?) Pepper was born in about 1874 or 1875 in 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/notts_area/notts_area_main.htm" target="main"
title="Map Showing Places In Nottingham Area">
Nottingham</a>.
She was the second child of 

<a href="../pepper_2nd_robert_pepper/pepper_2nd_robert_pepper_frame.htm"
title="Robert Pepper's Entry">
 Robert Pepper</a>, a Railway Labourer, and

<p>
Eliza had two sisters and one brother. These were:-

</blockquote>

<p>
The first reference to Eliza is the

target="main" title="Eliza's Entry In 1881 Census">
 1881 Census</a>.
She was 6 years old and living with her parents at 25 Newbridge Street, 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/meadows/meadows_main.htm" target="main"
title="Map Showing Meadows">
Meadows</a>, Nottingham. Her father worked as a Railway Labourer and her mother
as a Hosiery Works Maker Up.
</p>

<p>
In December 1882 her father died and her mother was left to bring up the three
children, the youngest of whom was about 1 year old, on her own.
</p>

<p>
When the 

<a

target="main" title="Eliza's Entry In 1891 Census">
 1891 Census</a>  was taken Eliza was 16 years old and still living at home in Newbridge
Street. In the Census she is described as a Scholar.<br>
At first sight it seems surprising that she was still at school as the
family were obviously poor following her father's death. Her mother and older
sister were both working as was her younger, 12 year old, sister. However there
was a reason for this.
</p>

<p>
According to Peggy Davies, the daughter-in-law of Eliza's sister
Florence, Eliza was the only sister that Florence ever mentioned.
Apparently Eliza never worked. Peggy Davies remembers that when
Florence Pepper was living with her at 203 Dentons Green Lane, St Helens she
sometimes received letters from the Matron of a Nursing Home or Mental Hospital
about Eliza. She says that Florence told her that Eliza had suffered brain
damage as a result of being hit on the head by a schoolmaster. Whether this was
true, or whether she was mentally subnormal we do not know.
</p>

<p>
By the time of the 

<a

target="main" title="Eliza's Entry In 1901 Census">
 1901 Census</a>  it would seem that Eliza's mother had died as Eliza, who was
now 26 years old was living at 12 Newthorpe Street, Nottingham, the home of her
married sister Alice. Eliza still had no occupation.

<p>
Eliza died sometime after Florence Pepper came to live at Dentons Green Lane, St
Helens, that is after 1946.
