Robert John Henry Pepper was born in about 1881 or 1882 in 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/notts_area/notts_area_main.htm" target="main"
title="Map Showing Places In Nottingham Area">
Nottingham</a>. He was the third child of 

<a href="../pepper_2nd_robert_pepper/pepper_2nd_robert_pepper_frame.htm"
title="Robert Pepper's Entry">
 Robert Pepper</a>, a Railway Labourer, and

<p>
Robert had three sisters. These were:-

</blockquote>

<p>
The first reference to Robert is the 

<a

target="main" title="Robert's Entry In 1881 Census">
1891 Census</a>. He was 9 years old and living with his mother at 25 Newbridge Street, 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/meadows/meadows_main.htm" target="main"
title="Map Showing Meadows">
Meadows</a>, Nottingham. His mother worked as a Hosiery Mender.<br />
His father had died in December 1882, just after Robert was born.
</p>

<p>
By the time of the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1901_pepper_nottingham/1901_pepper_nottingham_main.htm#3robert"
target="main" title="Robert's Entry In 1901 Census">
 1901 Census</a>  it would seem that Robert's mother had died as Robert, whose age
is given as 17 years old, was living at 12 Newthorpe Street, Nottingham, the home of
his married sister Alice. Robert was single and working as a Pawnbroker's
Assistant.<br />
There are two errors in his entry in the Census Return. He is described as being 17 years old
which can't be correct as this would mean that he was born in 1883 or 1884, well
after his father's death in 1882. Also his first name is given as &quot;Jno&quot;,
which is short for &quot;John&quot;, and not as &quot;Robert&quot;.
</p>

<p>
Peggy Davies, the daughter-in-law of Robert's sister Florence, thinks
that he died when he was quite young, possibly aged 20 or 21.
