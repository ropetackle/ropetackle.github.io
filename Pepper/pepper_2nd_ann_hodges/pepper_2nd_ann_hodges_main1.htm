</blockquote>

<p>
The first reference to Ann is on her Birth Certificate. When he registered her
birth her father gave his occupation as that of a Needle Maker. 
</p>

<p>
The next mentioned of Ann is when she married Robert Pepper in Nottingham on

<a
href="../../Documents/Marriage%20Certificates/1870_hodges_pepper/1870_hodges_pepper_mc_main.htm"
target="main" title="Copy Of Ann's Marriage Certificate">
 8 <sup>th</sup> October 1870</a> at the Parish Church of the Parish of St John
Baptist. The Marriage Certificate states that
she was 24 years old and living in High Street, Nottingham. Incidentally
it gives her name as Anna
</p>

<p>When her daughter Florence was born in 

<a
href="../../Documents/Birth%20Certificates/1879_florence_pepper/1879_florence_pepper_bc_main.htm"
target="main" title="Copy Of Florence Pepper's Birth Certificate">
January 1879</a>, Ann, or Annie as she now seems to be called, was living at 25 Newbridge Street,

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/meadows/meadows_main.htm" target="main"
title="Map Showing Meadows">
Meadows</a>, Nottingham and she and Robert already had 2 children, 
Alice and Eliza.
</p>

<p>
Annie is next mentioned in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1881_pepper_nottingham/1881_pepper_nottingham_main.htm#2ann"
target="main" title="Annie's Entry In 1881 Census">
 1881 Census</a>.
She was now 35 years old&nbsp; and still living at 25 Newbridge Street. She
worked as a Hosiery Works Maker Up. 
</p>

<p>
The next 18 months after the Census were quite dramatic for Annie. At some time in the 12 months after the Census
her son Robert was born and on 

<a
href="../../Documents/Death%20Certificates/1882_robert_pepper/1882_robert_pepper_dc_main.htm"
target="main" title="Copy Of Robert Pepper's Death Certificate">
24<sup>th</sup> December 1882</a> her husband Robert died leaving her to bring
up the family on her own. 
</p>

<p>
When the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1891_pepper_nottingham/1891_pepper_nottingham_main.htm#2ann"
target="main" title="Annie's Entry In 1891 Census">
1891 Census</a> was taken Annie gave her age as 43. 
She was still living at 25 Newbridge Street.
To support herself and her family she worked as a Hosiery Mender.
Hosiery Mending, which would be done for a Hosiery manufacturer, involved making good defects in new
hosiery and was typically done at home and was &quot;piece work&quot; and therefore poorly paid. 
She probably worked at home with her eldest daughter Alice who was also a Hosiery Mender and still 
lived with her.
</p>

<p>
Life must have been extremely hard for Annie and her family without her husband's income.
Her son Robert was only 9 and still at school. 
What must have made conditions harder was that her second daughter Eliza, who was now 16, 
is believed to have suffered from some form of brain damage and 
was not capable of earning a living and thereby adding to the family income. 
Their only income, apart from that which she and Alice earned by their Hosiery Mending, was that which 
Florence could get as 12 year old Errand Girl.
</p>

<p>
Annie is thought to have died between Census of 1891 and that of 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1901_pepper_nottingham/1901_pepper_nottingham_main.htm"
target="main" title="Copy Of Pepper 1901 Census Entry">
1901</a> as the latter shows that Eliza, Florence and Robert were then living with
their older married sister Alice and her husband.
