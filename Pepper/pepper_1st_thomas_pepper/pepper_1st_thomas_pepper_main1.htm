<p>
Thomas Pepper was born between 1815 and 1817.&nbsp;<br />
There is some confusion as to where he was born.
According to the 1841 Census he was born in the County of Leicestershire, however the 1851 Census 
gives his birth place as Sutton, Nottinghamshire.<br />
Nothing is known about his parents.
</p>

<p>
Thomas married 

<a href="../pepper_1st_alice_sharp/pepper_1st_alice_sharp_frame.htm"
title="Alice Sharp's Entry">
 Alice Sharp</a> and they had at least 7 children. These were:-

</blockquote>

<p>
The first reference to Thomas is on the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Birth%20Certificates/1839_robert_pepper/1839_robert_pepper_bc_main.htm"
target="main">
 Birth Certificate</a> of his son Robert who was born in February 1839.
He was an Agricultural Labourer and living at Newton Nethercote in the Parish of Swepstone, Leicestershire.
Swepstone lies roughly half way between Measham, which is just off the A42 south of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, 
and Ibstock, which is on the A447.
<br />
The current Ordinance Survey map for Swepstone does not show any place called Newton Nethercote. 
There is a village called Newton Burgoland and a Nethercote Farm. 
Both of these are in the parish of Swepstone and about 1 km away. 
As he was an Agricultural Labourer it is possible that they were actually living at

<a href="../../maps/pepper_maps/swepstone/swepstone_main.htm" target="main">
 Nethercote Farm</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thomas is next mentioned in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1841_pepper_swepstone/1841_pepper_swepstone_main.htm"
target="main">
 1841 Census</a>.
He was then 25 years old, working as an Agricultural Labourer and living with his wife and 4 children, Fanny, 
William, Robert and Elizabeth, at 

<a href="../../maps/pepper_maps/swepstone/swepstone_main.htm" target="main">
 Dishley</a> in the Parish of Swepstone, Leicestershire.<br />

<a
href="../../Places%20&amp;%20Buildings/dishley_farm_swepstone/dishley_farm_main.htm"
target="main" title="Photo Of Dishley Farm">
Dishley Farm</a> is about 1km. from Swepstone and it is assumed that he was working at that 
farm at the time.
</p> 

<p>
When Thomas's daughter Esther was born in February 1843 the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Birth%20Certificates/1843_esther_pepper/1843_esther_pepper_bc_main.htm"
target="main">
 Birth Certificate</a>
records the place of birth as simply Swepstone. He was still an Agricultural Labourer.<br />
</p> 

<p>
When the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1851_pepper_swepstone/1851_pepper_swepstone_main.htm"
target="main">
 1851 Census</a> was taken Thomas was living in Swepstone village.
His age is given as 34 and he is still working as an Agricultural Labourer.
Two of his children, Fanny and William, had left home.<br />
It is possible that he might have been partially disabled as the 1851 Census Return included a column for 
recording whether a person was blind, deaf or dumb.
On the Microfilm of the Census Return there appears to be what looks like a distinct tick in that column.
It might, however, be only a scratch on the film.
</p>


<p>
When his son Robert married in October 1870 the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Marriage%20Certificates/1870_hodges_pepper/1870_hodges_pepper_mc_main.htm"
target="main" title="Copy Of Robert Pepper's Marriage Certificate">
Marriage Certificate</a> gave Thomas's occupation as that of Labourer.
