      <p>
      The first reference to Robert is on his Birth Certificate.
      He was born on 16<sup>th</sup> February 1839 at Newton Nethercote,
      Swepstone. His father's occupation is given as an Agricultural Labourer.
      When his mother registered his birth she did not sign but instead
      &quot;made her mark&quot; with an <b>X</b>.<br />
      The current Ordinance Survey map for Swepstone does not show any place
      called Newton Nethercote. There is a village called Newton Burgoland and a
      Nethercote Farm. Both of theses are in the parish of Swepstone and about 1
      km away from the village. As his father was an Agricultural Labourer it is
      possible that they were actually living at

 Robert is next mentioned in the

      living with his parents at

      was still an Agricultural Labourer.<br />

      target="main" title="Photo Of Dishley Farm">
      Dishley Farm</a> is about 1km. from Swepstone and it is assumed that his
      father was working at that farm at the time.
      </p>

      When Robert's sister Esther was born in

      Robert was by then 12 years old and at school and his family were still
      living in Swepstone village and his father still worked as an Agricultural
      Labourer..
