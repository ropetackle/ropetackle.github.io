William Pepper was born in Leicestershire, probably in <a href="../../maps/pepper_maps/swepstone_location/swepstone_location_main.htm"

Swepstone</a>, in about 1836 or 1837. He was the second child of

 Thomas Pepper</a>, an Agricultural Labourer, 
and

William had at least two brothers and four sisters. These were:-

<p>
When William's younger brother Robert was born in February 1839 he was living with
his family at Newton Nethercote, in the Parish of Swepstone, Leicestershire.<br />
The current Ordinance Survey map for Swepstone does not show any place called
Newton Nethercote. There is a village called Newton Burgoland and a Nethercote
Farm. Both of these are in the parish of Swepstone and about 1 km away. As his father was an Agricultural Labourer it is possible that they were actually
living at

 Nethercote Farm</a>.

The only reference to William is in the

 1841 Census</a>. He was then 4 years old and
living with his parents at

Dishley</a>, in the Parish of Swepstone.<br />

<a

target="main" title="Photo Of Dishley Farm">
Dishley Farm</a> is about 1km. from Swepstone and it is assumed that her father was
working at that farm at the time.
</p>

<p>
When his sister Esther was born in February 1843 William and his family were living in Swepstone.
</p> 
 
<p>
By the time the 1851 Census was taken he was no longer living at home.
