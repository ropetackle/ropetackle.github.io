Alice had two sisters and one brother. These were:-

She was 9 years old and living with her parents at 25 Newbridge Street,

Meadows</a>, Nottingham. Her father worked as a Railway Labourer and her mother
as a Hosiery Works Maker Up.
</p>

<p>
In December 1882 her father died and her mother was left to bring up the three
children, the youngest of whom was about 1 year old, on her own.

Joiner and Undertaker and they were living at 12 Newthorpe Street, Nottingham.
Her mother seems to have died as her sisters and brother were also living with
her and her husband.
