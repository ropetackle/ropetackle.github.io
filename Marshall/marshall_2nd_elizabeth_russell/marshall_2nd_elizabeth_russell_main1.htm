<p>
Elizabeth was born in Glasgow in about 1850 or 1851. Nothing is known about her parents.
</p>

<p>
She married

<p>
The first reference to Elizabeth is in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1881_marshall_nottingham/1881_marshall_nottingham_main.htm#2elizabeth"
target="main" title=" Elizabeth's 1881 Census Entry">
 1881 Census</a>.
She was 30 years old and living with her husband Thomas and her first two
children, George and Mary at 5 Potts Square, Pierrepont Street in the Parish of St
Marys, 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/notts_area/notts_area_main.htm" target="main"
title="Places In Nottingham Area">
Nottingham</a>.
</p>

<p>
Elizabeth was still living at Potts Square when her third child, Thomas, was born on

<a
href="../../Documents/Birth%20Certificates/1881_thomas_marshall/1881_thomas_marshall_bc_main.htm"
target="main" title=" Thomas Marshall's Birth Certificate">
 12<sup>th</sup> April 1881</a>,
nine days after the Census.

<p>
A point of interest from his Birth Certificate is that when Elizabeth registered his birth she did not sign 
the Register of Births but, as the copy of his Birth Certificate shows,&quot; made her mark&quot;. 
This probably meant that she could neither read nor write.
</p>

<p>
By the time of the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1891_marshall_nottingham/1891_marshall_nottingham_main.htm#2elizabeth"
target="main" title=" Elizabeth's 1891 Census Entry">
 1891 Census</a> the family had moved from Potts Square to a 4 roomed house at 
6 Skelton Terrace, Hawthorne Street, 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/wilford/wilford_main.htm" target="main"
title=" Map Showing Wilford">
Wilford</a>, Nottingham.
Elizabeth was now 40 years old and had 4 more children, William, Thirza, Elizabeth, and Charlotte.&nbsp;<br>
The house appears to have been a typical C19<sup>th</sup> working class house, probably a “2 up and 2 down”
and
Conditions in the house must have been crowded as, in addition to the 9 members of the Marshall family, 
there was also a 16 year old lodger, Samuel Featherstone, a Coal Mine Pit Boy.

<p>
When the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1901_marshall_nottingham/1901_marshall_nottingham_main.htm#2elizabeth"
target="main" title=" Elizabeth's 1901 Census Entry">
1901 Census</a> was taken, Elizabeth was 50 years old and still living with in Hawthorn Street.
By then she and Thomas had another child, Annie.<br />
In the Census Return their address is given as 6 Cary Cottages and not 6 Skelton Terrace.
It is not known if these were the same or different houses. 
However, in view of the fact that the numbers are the same and that the 1891 Census Returns do not mention 
there being any Cary Cottages in Hawthorne Street, it is almost certain that they were one and the 
same house.
</p>

<p>
When her son Thomas joined the Army in August 1901, both Elizabeth and her Thomas were still 
living at 6 Cary Cottages. 
</p>

<p>
Some time after her son Thomas joined the Army, Elizabeth may have either moved to 62 Briar Street,

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/meadows/meadows_main.htm" target="main"
title=" Map Showing Meadows">
Meadows</a>, Nottingham or died. 
The evidence for this is the change in the address of his Next-Of-Kin in
Thomas's Army Small Book. 
This change probably took place at some time between 1901 and 1911, possibly round about 1903.
