The first reference to Elizabeth is in the

target="main" title=" Elizabeth's Entry In 1891 Census">
1891 Census</a>. She was then 4 years old and living with her parents at 6 Skelton
Terrace, Hawthorne Street, 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/wilford/wilford_main.htm" target="main"
title=" Map Showing Wilford">
Wilford</a>, Nottingham.<br />
The house appears to have been a typical C19<sup>th</sup> working class house,
probably a “2 up and 2 down”.

<p>
When the

title=" Elizabeth's 1901 Census Entry" target="main">
 1901 Census</a> was taken Elizabeth was 14 years old, still living with her parents at 6 Cary Cottages, Hawthorne
Street, Wilford, Nottingham. she was now working as a Hosiery Machinist.<br />
The address is given as 6 Cary Cottages and not 6 Skelton Terrace. It is not
known if these were the same or different houses. However, in view of the fact
that the numbers are the same and that the 1891 Census Returns do not mention
any Cary Cottages in Hawthorne Street, it is almost certain that they were one
and the same house.
