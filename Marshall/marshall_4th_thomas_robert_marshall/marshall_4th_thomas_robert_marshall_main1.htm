</p>


<p>
On the 19<sup>th</sup> February 1914, with the increasing threat of a war
against Germany, Tommy and his parents returned to Britain when the 1 Battalion were
recalled from South Africa. They arrived at Gosport, Hampshire, a month later.
</p>


<p>
When his father was discharged from the Army having completed his 21 years
service they were living in Glasgow.
</p>


<p>
Tommy won a scholarship to Allen Glens Grammar School in Glasgow and
wanted to become a Civil Engineer. Unfortunately his parents could not afford
for him to stay at school and go to University so he joined Triplex Northern, a subsidiary
of the glass makers Pilkington Brothers, as an Office Boy.<br />
Triplex Northern supplied safety glass for vehicle windscreens and he eventually
became their Commercial Representative for Scotland, dealing with the bus
operators in that Country.
</p>


<p>
When he was in Glasgow he was a keen cyclist and when he came to St Helens,
where Head Office of the Pilkington Group was to train as their Commercial
Representative, he joined the St Helens Section of the
Cyclist Touring Club. It was through this interest that he met his future wife,
