<p>
Later that year, because of the imminent threat of war, Tommy was called
back to St Helens and he and his family returned there. They went to live at

<p>
Tommy realised that as the war went on he would be conscripted into one
of the Armed Services and therefore volunteered for the RAF to train as a
Medical Orderly. However when he had finished his basic training he was
&quot;asked&quot; to &quot;volunteer&quot; to become a Radio Operator. At the
time no one knew what this involved. There were Radio Telegraphists who used
Morse Code to communicate with aircraft, and Wireless Operators who used verbal
communication. What a Radio Operator did was then &quot;Top Secret&quot;, even
the volunteers did not know what they had volunteered for! It eventually turned
out that the title of a Radio Operator was a cover name for what was
subsequently known as a Radar Operator, Radar having been just invented and very
much considered as being a &quot;Secret Weapon&quot; in Britain's defence plans.
</p>


<p>
After training as a Radar Operator he was posted to a Radar Station in Scotland
at Corsewall Point on the North West tip of Loch Ryan, Galloway.
</p>


<p>
From what he said, life there was very comfortable. He lived in lodgings in
Kirkcolm and for a period his wife and son went to stay with him in his
lodgings.
</p>


<p>
While in the RAF Tommy suffered from appendicitis and went to hospital
to have his appendix removed. He says that his medical records were confused
with those of another serviceman who had an incurable fatal illness. As a result
he was discharged from the RAF as medically unfit - he often wondered what
happened to the other man!
</p>


<p>
Upon his discharge from the RAF he returned to Pilkington Brothers in St Helens
and worked in their Work Study Department. Subsequently he joined their
Industrial Relations Department and eventually became the Chief Industrial
Relations Officer for the whole Pilkington Group.
</p>


<p>
After the War had ended Tommy and his family moved to

title="Photo Of 203 Dentons Green Lane">
203 Dentons Green Lane</a> and they lived there until he moved to

117B Higher Lane, Rainford</a> in the 1960s. He lived at Rainford until his
death.

<p>
Thomas died unexpectedly, aged 58, on

driven home when he suffered a major heart attack and collapsed and died in the
car.
