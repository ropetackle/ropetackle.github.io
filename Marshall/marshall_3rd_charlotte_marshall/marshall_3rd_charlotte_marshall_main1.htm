The first reference to Charlotte is in the 

<a

target="main" title=" Charlotte's Entry In 1891 Census">
1891 Census</a>. 
She was then 1 year old and living with her parents at 6 Skelton Terrace,
Hawthorne Street, Wilford, Nottingham. 
The house appears to have been a typical C19<sup>th</sup> working class house,
probably a “2 up and 2 down”.

<p>
When the 

<a

target="main" title=" Charlotte's Entry In 1901 Census">
1901 Census</a> was taken Charlotte was 11 years old. 
She was still living with
her parents at 6 Cary Cottages, Hawthorne Street, Wilford, Nottingham.<br />
The address is given as 6 Cary Cottages and not 6 Skelton Terrace. It is not
known if these were the same or different houses. However, in view of the fact
that the numbers are the same and that the 1891 Census Returns do not mention
any Cary Cottages in Hawthorne Street, it is almost certain that they were one
and the same house.
