Mary was the daughter of 

<a href="../marshall_a_thomas_lamb/marshall_a_thomas_lamb_frame.htm"
title=" Thomas Lamb's Entry">
 Thomas Lamb</a>, a Publican, and his wife 

<a href="../marshall_a_ann_lamb/marshall_a_ann_lamb_frame.htm"

Ann</a>.
She was born at

target="main" title=" Map Showing Easthorpe">
Easthorpe</a>, Bottesford, Leicestershire in 1824 or 1825.
</p>

She married 

<a
href="../marshall_1st_william_marshall/marshall_1st_william_marshall_frame.htm"
title=" William Marshall's Entry">
 William Marshall</a>, a Bricklayer, in July 1850 and they had at least 5 children. 
These were:-

<p>
The first reference to Mary seems to be in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1841_lamb_bottesford/1841_lamb_bottesford_main.htm#1mary"
target="main" title=" Mary's entry In 1841 Census Return">
 1841 Census</a>.
An Edward Lamb, a Publican aged 50, was living in 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/bottesford_details/bottesford_main.htm"
target="main" title=" Map Showing Church Street">
 Church Street</a>, Easthorpe, Bottesford with his wife 
Ann Lamb, aged 40, and his daughter Mary, aged 15. Although no further
information is given as to their address, it is possible that they were living
at the Public House which is now known as the 

<a href="../../Places%20&amp;%20Buildings/red_lion_bottesford/red_lion_main.htm"
target="main" title=" Photo Of The Red Lion">
 Red Lion </a> and which is on the
corner of Church Street and Grantham Road.
</p>

<p>Although the Census gives the forename of the Head of the Household as Edward, not Thomas, the age of his wife and daughter, 
together with his trade of Publican, tally with the information from Mary Lamb's Marriage Certificate for 1850 
and the 1861 Census. 
It seems likely that the two Mary Lambs were the one and the same person.
</p>

<p>
Although modern day Easthorpe is a small hamlet on the south eastern&nbsp;
outskirts of Bottesford it appears that, in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century,
Easthorpe was all of the area of Bottesford south of the River Devon. The Church
was in Bottesford, Church Street in Easthorpe. This would explain why the 19<sup>th</sup>
Century Census Returns for Easthorpe show that its population was much larger
that its present size would indicate.

<p>
The next mention of Mary is her 

<a
href="../../Documents/Marriage%20Certificates/1850_lamb_marshall/1850_lamb_marshall_mc_main.htm"
target="main" title=" Mary's Marriage Certificate">
 Marriage Certificate</a>.
She married William Marshall on 1<sup>st</sup> July 1850 at the Parish Church in the Parish of 
St Mary, 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/notts_area/notts_area_main.htm" target="main"
title="Map Of Places In Nottingham Area">
Nottingham</a>.
When she married she was living at an address at 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/high_pavement/high_pavement_main.htm"
target="main" title=" Map Showing High Pavement">
 High Pavement</a>, Nottingham. 
This seems to have been a residential street in the centre of Nottingham and it is possible that she had 
been in service in one of the houses in that area.
At the time of her marriage she was not working as she was 8 months pregnant.
</p>

<p>
Six weeks after her marriage her first child, Thomas, was born , on 

<a
href="../../Documents/Birth%20Certificates/1850_thomas_marshall/1850_thomas_marshall_bc_main.htm"
target="main" title=" Thomas Marshall's Birth Certificate">
 19th August 1850</a> at Easthorpe.
</p>

<p>
Mary is next mentioned in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1861_marshall_bottesford/1861_marshall_bottesford_main.htm#1mary"
target="main" title=" Mary's Entry In 1861 Census Return">
 1861 Census</a>. She was now 36 years old and living
with her husband William and their 5 children at The Beershop, Easthorpe, 
Bottesford. Also living with them was her mother Ann Lamb.&nbsp; 
It is possibly that they were living at the premises where her father had been the Publican before he died.
