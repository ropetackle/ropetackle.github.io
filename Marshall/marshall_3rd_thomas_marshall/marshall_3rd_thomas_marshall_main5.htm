Post War Service - 1919 To 1922
</h2>

<p>
On its return from Germany in 1919, the remnants of the 1RSF went to Ayr and
then Greenock where it was brought back up to strength. Later that year it moved
to Bordon Camp, Hampshire.
</p>

<p>
In January 1921 the 1 RSF was sent to Ireland for operations in aid of the
government during the Troubles and were stationed at <span

the Irish leaders the Battalion left Ireland in 1922. &nbsp;
</p>

<p>
Thomas was with the Battalion in Ireland although he is thought to have returned
early to England as a result of a leg injury. According to his son, he always
said that although he had told the military officials that he and his group had
been escaping from an attack by some Irish, they had actually been returning
from a bar, drunk, when he fell over the edge of a quarry in the dark.
</p>

<p>
On its return from Ireland in April 1922 the Battalion moved to Glasgow and it
was there that he was discharged from the Army on 9th August 1922 after
completing 21 years service with the 1st Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers.
