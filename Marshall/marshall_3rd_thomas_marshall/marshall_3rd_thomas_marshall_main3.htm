Home Leave - 1909
</h2>

<p>
In December 1908 the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers transferred to Rangoon in Burma and on the 20<sup>th</sup> February 1909 sailed back to Britain.
Thomas arrived there on the 25<sup>th</sup> March 1909 after almost 6 ½ years away from his family.
</p>

<p>
It seems most likely that a large part, if not all, of his time in England was
spent at the family home as Thomas does not mention any postings in Britain
during that period.&nbsp; During this period of leave it seems that he was
living at 62 Briar Street, 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/meadows/meadows_main.htm" target="main"
title=" Map Showing Meadows">
Meadows</a>, Nottingham which was about a mile from his family's previous home
in 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/wilford/wilford_main.htm" target="main"
title=" Map Showing Wilford">
Wilford</a>.<br />
Whether his parents had moved or whether one or other of them had died and Briar
Street was the home of his brother George or one of his other brothers or
sisters is not known.
</p>

It was almost certainly during this period of leave in Nottingham that Thomas met

 Florence Pepper</a>, 
who also lived in the Meadows area of Nottingham.

<p>
By the time Thomas sailed from Britain back to Rangoon, on the 7th October 1909,
he and Florence were engaged to be married.
</p>

<h2 class="main">
Second Tour Of Duty And Marriage - 1909 T0 1914
</h2>

<p>
Thomas arrived back in Rangoon on the 18th January 1910 and three days later he
was once again with the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion in Port Blair.
</p>

<p>
Although the Battalion stayed at Port Blair until October 1910 they knew by the July of that year, 
if not earlier, that they were due to go to South Africa.
On 5th October 1910 Thomas left Port Blair for Rangoon and, 5 days later sailed from there to South Africa 
where he arrived on the 28th October 1910.
The 1st Battalion were stationed at Roberts Heights, Pretoria, in what was then known as the 
Province of Transvaal.
</p>

<p>
Immediately on arriving at Port Blair Thomas must have started to take steps to
arrange for his marriage to Florence.
</p>

<p>
One can imagine that arranging for his fiancée to come out to marry him could
not have been a simple exercise.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, although he was at Port Blair, Thomas knew by the July of that year, if
not earlier, that they were due to go to South Africa. By the time the
arrangements could be finalized for her to come out he would be in that country.
</p>

<p>
Secondly he would have to deal with the army and all its rules, regulations and
bureaucracy.
</p>

<p>
Any application to marry, especially when it involved the fiancée coming out
from England to Africa by military transport, would have had to progress through
the appropriate official channels and to have been approved at each step. How
difficult it was to marry in the army is shown by the following extract from his
Army Small Book.
</p>

<blockquote>
  “A soldier must not marry without first obtaining his commanding officer’s
  sanction, otherwise, although the marriage is legal, he can never have any
  claim to be borne on the married establishment of his corps.<br />
  A large proportion of serjeants is allowed on the married roll, also 3 per
  cent. of the trumpeters, drummers and rank and file who have completed seven
  years’ service, are in possession of at least two good conduct badges, and
  have at least £5 in the Army or Post Office Savings’ Bank. When a regiment
  goes to India the proportion of married men permitted to embark is
  increased”
</blockquote>

<p>
However difficult the procedure was, his application for permission to marry was
successful. On the 20th July 1910 a&nbsp; 

<a href="../../Documents/Pepper/army_letters_main1.htm" target="main"
title=" Army's 1st Letter To Florence Pepper">
letter</a> was sent to Florence Pepper from a Major Caird at the Infantry Records
Office, Hamilton, Scotland telling her that an application had been received
from the Commanding Officer, 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers,
requesting an Indulgence Passage for her to go to South Africa to marry Sergeant
T Marshall.
</p>

<p>
Further correspondence, ( 

<a href="../../Documents/Pepper/army_letters_main2.htm" target="main"
title=" Army's 2nd Letter To Florence Pepper">
letter 2</a>, 

<a href="../../Documents/Pepper/army_letters_main3.htm" target="main"

letter 3</a> and 

<a href="../../Documents/Pepper/army_letters_main4.htm" target="main"
title=" Army's 4th Letter To Florence Pepper">
letter 4</a>) took place between the Infantry
Records Office and Florence Pepper with the result that, on the 20th December
1910, she embarked at Southampton on the Transport Ship “Soudan” for Durban,
South Africa.
</p>

<p>
When you think of the length of notice that would be expected nowadays if you
were moving overseas, it is interesting to see how different it was then.<br />
On the 20th July the first letter was sent. This told her that the request for a
passage had been received. On the 10th December a letter was sent informing her
that she would be sailing from Southampton 10 days later!
</p>

<p>
Florence arrived in Durban in January 1911 and they were married there by
licence on the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Marriage%20Certificates/1911_pepper_marshall/1911_pepper_marshall_mc_main.htm"
target="main" title=" Thomas's Marriage Certificate">
16th January.</a>
</p>

<p>
According to his son, Thomas Robert, it was a requirement of the Army that if a
woman was allowed an Indulgence Passage overseas to marry a soldier then the
marriage had to take place immediately she landed in the country. Clearly the
army did not want any unattached white women providing possible temptations for
the soldiers! This was why they were married in Durban although he was stationed
at Pretoria, about 530 kilometres away.
</p>

<p>
Nine months later, on the

target="main" title=" Thomas Robert Marshall's Birth Certificate">

Thomas Robert</a>, (known as Tommy) was born at Roberts Heights, Pretoria. The birth was recorded
in the Battalion Orders dated 21st October 1911. On the 26th November Thomas
Robert was baptized there at the Garrison Church.
</p>

<p>Thomas and his family stayed in South Africa until 1914 and it was in that year that the oldest

photograph</a> there is of him was taken. 
In this photograph, which shows him with his platoon, he is the Platoon Sergeant sitting at the centre 
of the front row.
</p>

<p>
On the 19th February 1914, presumably because of the worsening situation in Europe, the Battalion
sailed back to England. They arrived at Gosport, Hampshire a month later.
