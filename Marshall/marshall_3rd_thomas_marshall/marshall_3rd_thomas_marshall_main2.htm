First Tour of Duty - 1901 To 1909
</h2>

On the 10<sup>th</sup> August 190, aged 20, he stopped being Thomas Marshall, bricklayer, of 
Nottingham and became Private 6877, Marshall T of the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers. 
(1RSF)
He signed on at Nottingham for a period of 7 years. He was to serve with the Regiment for 21.

<p>
It isn't known why Thomas joined the army, one can only guess. 
Almost certainly as an intelligent 20 year old he could see that there was no future in being a bricklayer.
The work would have been boring and the prospects poor. 
Life in the army would clearly involve adventure and travel and also good opportunities to better himself. 
Also, if as seems likely, he was working with his father the army would enable him to get away from home, 
from the crowded house, and to create his own life.
</p>

<p>
Neither do we know why he joined a Scottish regiment rather than one more local to the East Midlands. 
It might have been pure chance, they happened to be recruiting in the area at the time. 
It might have been that he knew that he would go abroad with the Royal Scots Fusiliers, 
the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion had been in India since 1896 and the 2<sup>nd </sup>Battalion
were in South Africa. 
Another factor might have been, that he was attracted to them because of his mother’s Scottish origins or 
even because she had some family connection with the Regiment.
She was born in Glasgow and the Royal Scots Fusiliers were a Glasgow Regiment. 
</p>

<p>
The Royal Scots Fusiliers were a Scottish Lowland regiment and their Regimental Headquarters were in 
Glasgow at the Maryhill Barracks.

of the Regiment in general and the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion in particular is given elsewhere.
Unlike the Highland regiments they did not wear kilts, They wore tartan trews and a Glengarry cap.</p>

<p>
What did Thomas look like? What sort of person was he?
</p>

<p>
Although he was still alive when I, Robin Marshall, was born unfortunately I cannot remember him.
</p>
<p>
The earliest

 photograph</a> of him is one taken with his Platoon in Pretoria, South Africa in 1914. 
He is the Sergeant sitting in the front row with the cup.
</p>

<p>
According to the description in his Army Small Book, the official army record book which every soldier 
was given and which recorded details of his military career, when he enlisted he was 5ft. 5 inches tall, 
with a fresh complexion, light brown hair, grey eyes, and the scar of a cut on both his left and right wrists. 
This bald description obviously does not tell us what he was really like.
</p>

<p>Thomas must have been considering an army career for some time as he enlisted in Nottingham on the 
10<sup>th</sup> August and on that same day went to join the 1RSF at their training Depot at Ayr in 
Scotland where he stayed for just over 3 months carrying out his basic training.
When his basic training was complete he moved to the Regimental Headquarters at Maryhill Barracks
in Glasgow where he stayed for almost a year. 
On the 8<sup>th</sup> October 1902 he was sent to Montrose and 20 days later sailed from there to join the 
1<sup>st</sup> Battalion&nbsp; in India.
</p>


By the 21<sup>st</sup> November 1902 Thomas was in India with the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion. 
He was to stay in that country for the next 6 years.

<p>
When Thomas joined the 1RSF they were stationed at Allahabad, which is in the North of
India on the River Ganges.
</p>

<p>
During Thomas's time in India the 1RSF moved between Allahabad and Bareilly which seem to have been the main Battalion 
Headquarters. 
Details of these postings, which are taken from his Small Book, are given in the

href="../../Documents/Marshall/army_career_thomas_marshall/thomas_marshall_army_career_main.htm"
target="main" title=" Summary Of Thomas's Army Career">
Summary of his Army Career.</a>
</p>

<p>
During his time at Bareilly he must have signed on for a further period of service as his original 
7 years enlistment would have been completed in August 1908.
</p>

<p>
In December 1908 the Battalion transferred to Rangoon in Burma and on the 20<sup>th</sup> February 1909
it sailed back to Britain. Thomas arrived there on the 25<sup>th</sup> March 1909 after almost 6 ½ years away from his family.

<h4 class="main">
Education
</h4>

<p>
Thomas's educational qualifications when he joined the Army are not known but it is unlikely that he had 
anything more than the basic literacy and numeracy skills which one had to have in those days before you 
could leave school. 
However he must have been both bright and intelligent as he quickly gained his Army 3<sup>rd</sup> 
Class Certificate of Education, in November 1903, followed by his 2<sup>nd</sup> Class Certificate 
ten months later.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Promotions
</h4>

<p>
The fact that he was intelligent and, almost certainly, ambitious is borne out by what seems to have been a 
fairly rapid rise through the ranks.
Within 6 ½ years of enlisting as a Private he had become a Sergeant, just short of his 27th birthday.
</p>

<p>
His promotion would undoubtedly have been helped by the fact that he seems to have kept out of trouble. 
He received his 1<sup>st</sup> Good Conduct Badge in August 1903, and his 2<sup>nd</sup> three years later. 
His son, Thomas Robert Marshall, once said that his father maintained that Good Conduct Badges were not 
awarded for being good at soldiering but for being good at not getting caught!
</p>

<p>
Full details of his promotions, which are taken from his Small Book, are given in the
Summary of his Army Career.
</p>

<h4 class="main">
Qualifications
</h4>

<p>
During his time in India he gained a number of qualifications which are listed in the
Summary of his Army Career.
Among the more interesting, and amusing, are his qualifications in Railway Duties as a Guard, 
Battalion Chiropodist and as a Qualified Scout.

Lord Kitchener's Memorandum
</h4>

<p>
One amusing relic of his time in India is his copy of an 

<a class="doc"
href="../../Documents/Marshall/kitchener_memo/Kitcheners_memo_main.htm"
target="main" title=" Lord Kitchener's Memorandum 1905">
official memorandum </a> 
issued in 1905 by Lord Kitchener, Commander in Chief in India, to all the soldiers under his command. 
This gave, in graphic detail, warnings on the dangers to health which would result from consorting with 
native women.
