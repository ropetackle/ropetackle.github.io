The first reference to Thomas is his Birth Certificate. When he was born
his parents were living at 5 Potts Square, Pierrepont Street in the 
Parish of St Mary’s, Nottingham.<br />
It is interesting to note that when she registered his birth his mother did not
sign the Register but &quot;made her mark&quot; with an &quot;<b>X</b>&quot;.
this would seem to indicate that she could not read or write.
</p>

<p>
When the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1891_marshall_nottingham/1891_marshall_nottingham_main.htm#3thomas"
target="main" title=" Thomas's 1891 Census Entry">
 1891 Census</a> was taken he was 10 years old.
By then the family had grown and Thomas had another brother and three more
sisters. The family had moved from Potts Square to a 4 roomed house at 6 Skelton Terrace, Hawthorne Street,

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/wilford/wilford_main.htm" target="main"
title=" Map Showing Wilford">
Wilford</a>, Nottingham. <br />
Wilford is about 2 miles South of the centre of Nottingham on what is now the A6514.&nbsp;<br>
Conditions in the house, which appears to have been a typical C19<sup>th</sup> working class house, probably a “2 up and 2 down”,
must have been crowded. 
In addition to the 9 members of the Marshall family there was also a 16 year old lodger,
Samuel Featherstone, a Coal Mine Pit Boy.
</p>

<p>
By the time of the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1901_marshall_nottingham/1901_marshall_nottingham_main.htm#3thomas"
target="main" title=" Thomas's 1901 Census Entry">
 1901 Census</a> Thomas was 20 years old and, like his father was
working as a Bricklayer. He was still living with his
parents and two brothers and five sisters and was probably working with his
father. They were living at 6 Cary Cottages, Hawthorne Street, Wilford,
Nottingham.<br />
Whether 6 Cary Cottages and not 6 Skelton Terrace were the same house is
not known but it is thought that they could have been. The fact that the numbers are the same and that the 1891 Census
Return does not make any mention of any Cary Cottages in Hawthorne Street points
in this direction. 
</p>

<p>It was on the 10<sup>th</sup> August of that year that he made the momentous
decision to change his profession. 
He enlisted in the Army for 7 years.
