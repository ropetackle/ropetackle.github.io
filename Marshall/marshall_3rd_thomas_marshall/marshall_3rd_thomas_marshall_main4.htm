World War I - 1914 To 1919
</h2>


From the day that Thomas joined the army he had carefully recorded, in the
back of his Small Book, all his postings. There is only one more entry after his
return to England from South Africa in 1914. That is for the 14th August 1914. The entry for that date is
simple and poignant . It records what seems to be the entry “14.8.14. France.
1Van” (1<sup>st</sup>  Vanguard?). It was on that date that the

 1<sup>st</sup>
 Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers </a> arrived in France as part of the British
Expeditionary Force.

<p>
On that date, after 13 years and 4 days in the army, his peacetime soldiering came to an end. 
Ten days earlier, on the 4th August 1914, war had been declared on Germany. 
World War I had started.
</p>

<p>
He went to France leaving behind in England his wife and his young son, not yet 3 
years old, not knowing if he would ever see them again.

<p>
The 1 RSF arrived France on 14<sup>th</sup> August 1914 as part of the original British 
Expeditionary Force (BEF).
It served in France and Flanders throughout the War and was involved in the fighting at

Mons</a>, Ypres, The Somme, Arras and on the Hindenburg Line. It finally left Germany in May
1919, much reduced in strength.
</p>

<p>
Nothing is known about which of these engagements he took part in but he was clearly involved in most
if not all of them. 
It is known that after one of the major battles, possibly one of the battles on The Somme, 
he returned on leave to his family who were staying with his brother George. 
He was apparently still caked from head to foot in the mud of the battlefield and, 
still with his uniform on, was stood in a tin bath while water was poured over him to get him clean.
</p>

<p>In July 1917 he was promoted to Company Sergeant Major.

<p>
He used to say that just good luck that he survived the War. The truth of this
is illustrated by the fact that one source states that&nbsp; the 1 RSF numbered 1000 when they
left Gosport for France in August 1914&nbsp; but by early January 1915 they had
suffered 261 fatal casualties and many more had been wounded.
</p>

<p>
On its return from Germany in 1919, the remnants of the 1RSF went to Ayr and then Greenock where 
it was brought back up to strength.
Later that year it moved to Bordon Camp, Hampshire.
