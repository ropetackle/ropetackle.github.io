<p>
The earliest reference to Thomas is his Birth Certificate. When he was born his
parents were living in Easthorpe, Bottesford and his father was a Bricklayer. 
</p>

<p>
The next reference to him is in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1861_marshall_bottesford/1861_marshall_bottesford_main.htm#2thomas"
target="main" title=" Thomas's Entry In 1861 Census">
 1861 Census</a>. He was then 10 years old and living with his parents, brothers
and sister,
and maternal grandmother, 

<a href="../marshall_a_ann_lamb/marshall_a_ann_lamb_frame.htm"
title=" Ann Lamb's Entry">
 Ann Lamb</a>, at the Beershop, Easthorpe, Bottesford. 
It is possible that this was the licensed premises in 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/bottesford_details/bottesford_main.htm"
target="main" title=" Map Showing Church Street">
 Church Street</a>, where his maternal Grandfather, 

<a href="../marshall_a_thomas_lamb/marshall_a_thomas_lamb_frame.htm"
title=" Thomas Lamb's Entry">
Thomas Lamb</a>, had been the Publican. There is currently a Public house, 

<a href="../../Places%20&amp;%20Buildings/red_lion_bottesford/red_lion_main.htm"
target="main" title=" Photo Of The Red Lion">
 The Red Lion</a>, on the corner of Church Street and Grantham Road which might
have been where he was living. 
</p>

<p>
When the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1881_marshall_nottingham/1881_marshall_nottingham_main.htm#2thomas"
target="main" title=" Thomas's Entry In 1881 Census">
 1881 Census</a> was taken he was living at 5 Potts Square, Pierrepont
Street in the Parish of St Marys, 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/notts_area/notts_area_main.htm" target="main"
title="Places In Nottingham Area">
Nottingham</a>.
He was 30 years old, was married to Elizabeth Russell and, like his father, working
as a Bricklayer. He and Elizabeth already had two children, George and Mary.
</p>

<p>
It was at Potts Square that his third child, Thomas, was born on 

<a
href="../../Documents/Birth%20Certificates/1881_thomas_marshall/1881_thomas_marshall_bc_main.htm"
target="main" title=" Thomas Marshall's Birth Certificate">
 12<sup>th</sup> April 1881</a>, nine days after the Census.
</p>

<p>
By the time of the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1891_marshall_nottingham/1891_marshall_nottingham_main.htm#2thomas"
target="main" title=" Thomas's 1891 Census Entry">
1891 Census</a> the family had moved from Potts Square to a 4 roomed house at 6
Skelton Terrace, Hawthorne Street, 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/wilford/wilford_main.htm" target="main"
title=" Map Showing Wilford">
Wilford</a>, Nottingham. Thomas was now 40 years old, still a Bricklayer and
there were four more children, William, Thirza, Elizabeth, and Charlotte.<br />
The house appears to have been a typical C19<sup>th</sup> working class house,
probably a “2 up and 2 down” and Conditions in the house must have been
crowded as, in addition to the 9 members of the Marshall family, there was also
a 16 year old lodger, Samuel Featherstone, a Coal Mine Pit Boy.

<p>
When the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1901_marshall_nottingham/1901_marshall_nottingham_main.htm#2thomas"
target="main" title=" Thomas's 1901 Census Entry">
1901 Census</a> was taken, Thomas was 50 years old, still a Bricklayer, and
still living in Hawthorn Street. By then he and Elizabeth had another child,
Annie.<br />
In the Census Return their address is given as 6 Cary Cottages and not 6 Skelton
Terrace. It is not known if these were the same or different houses. However, in
view of the fact that the numbers are the same and that the 1891 Census Returns
do not mention there being any Cary Cottages in Hawthorne Street, it is almost
certain that they were one and the same house.
</p>

<p>
When his son Thomas joined the Army in August 1901, both Thomas and Elizabeth
were still living at 6 Cary Cottages.
</p>

<p>
Some time after his son Thomas joined the Army, Thomas may have either moved to
62 Briar Street, 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/meadows/meadows_main.htm" target="main"
title=" Map Showing Meadows">
Meadows</a>, Nottingham or died. The evidence for this is the change in the
address of his Next-Of-Kin in Thomas's Army Small Book. This change probably
took place at some time between 1901 and 1911, possibly round about 1903.
</p>

<p>
Very little is known about Thomas. 
His grandson, Thomas Robert Marshall, used to say that Thomas strongly disliked 
Jesse Boot, the man who founded Boots the Chemists, because Jesse never paid his bills. 
In particular he never paid for some building work that Thomas had carried out for him. 
Thomas apparently also claimed that it was by not paying his bills that Jesse made 
his fortune!
