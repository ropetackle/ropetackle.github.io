      target="main" title="Map Showning Church Street">
 Church Street</a>, Easthorpe, Bottesford. Her husband is described as a

      target="main" title="Photo Of Red Lion">
      The Red Lion</a>, on the corner of Church Street and Grantham Road and

      William Marshall</a>, at the Beershop, Easthorpe. 
      She was a widow and her profession

      It is possible that the Beershop was where her husband had carried out his
      business of Publican.
