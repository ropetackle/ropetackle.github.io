<p>
Thomas (Edward?) Lamb was born in Leicestershire, probably in the 

<a
href="../../maps/marshall_maps/bottesford_location/bottesford_location_main.htm"
target="main" title="Map Showing Location Of Bottesford">
 Bottesford area</a> and possibly in 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/bottesford_details/bottesford_main.htm"
target="main" title="Map Showing Easthorpe">
Easthorpe</a>, in about 1790 or 1791.
Nothing is known about his parents.
</p>

<p>
He married 

<a href="../marshall_a_ann_lamb/marshall_a_ann_lamb_frame.htm"
title="Ann Lamb's Entry">
 Ann Lamb</a> and they had at least one child, 

<a href="../marshall_1st_mary_lamb/marshall_1st_mary_lamb_frame.htm"
title="Mary Lamb's Entry">
Mary</a>.
</p>

<p>
The earliest reference to Thomas is possibly in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1841_lamb_bottesford/1841_lamb_bottesford_main.htm#aedward"
target="main" title="Thomas's 1841 Census Entry">
 1841 Census</a>.
This records that there was an Edward Lamb, a Publican aged 50, living in 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/bottesford_details/bottesford_main.htm"
target="main" title="Map Showing Church Street">
 Church Street</a>, Easthorpe, Bottesford. 
His wife is given as Ann Lamb, aged 40, and his daughter as Mary, aged 15. 
Although the forename is different, the age of his wife and daughter, together with his trade of Publican, 
tally with the information from Mary Lamb's 

<a
href="../../Documents/Marriage%20Certificates/1850_lamb_marshall/1850_lamb_marshall_mc_main.htm"
target="main" title="Mary Lamb's Marriage Certificate">
 Marriage Certificate</a> for 1850 and the information in the 

<a
href="../../Documents/Census%20Returns/1861_marshall_bottesford/1861_marshall_bottesford_main.htm"
target="main" title="1861 Census Return">
1861 Census</a>.
It is quite likely that this Edward Lamb and Thomas Lamb were one and the same person.<br>
There is now what was originally an old Public House, 

<a href="../../Places%20&amp;%20Buildings/red_lion_bottesford/red_lion_main.htm"
target="main" title="Photo Of Red Lion">
The Red Lion</a>, on the corner of Church Street and Grantham Road and this may
have been where they were living and where he carried out his business.
</p>

<p>
Thomas is next mention in 1850 on the Marriage Certificate of his daughter Mary.
He is still alive and his profession is given as that of Victualler. 
</p>

<p>Thomas seems to have died some time between 1850 and the 1861 Census as the
Census records his wife as being a widow.
