<p>
When Robin was born his parents were living in 

<a
href="../../maps/marshall_maps/hillington_location/hillington_location_main.htm"
target="main" title="Map Showing Location Of Hillington">
Hillington</a>, Glasgow at 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/gladsmuir_road/gladsmuir_road_main.htm"
target="main" title="Map Showing Gladsmuir Road">
50 Gladsmuir Road</a>. His
father worked for Triplex Northern, a subsidiary of the glass making&nbsp;
company Pilkington Brothers, as their Commercial Representative in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
When it became clear later in 1939 that war with Germany was inevitable Robin's
father was moved to 

<a href="../../maps/marshall_maps/st_helens_area/st_helens_area_main.htm"
target="main" title="Map Showing Location Of Places In St Helens Area">
 St Helens</a>, Lancashire where the Head Office of the Pilkington
Group was located. The family settled at 

<a href="../../Places%20&amp;%20Buildings/the_grove/the_grove_main.htm"
target="main" title="Photo Of 4 The Grove">
 4 The Grove</a>, Bleak Hill, St Helens and
they lived there throughout the War.
</p>

<p>
After the War the family moved to 

<a
href="../../Places%20&amp;%20Buildings/dentons_green_lane/dentons_green_main.htm"
target="main" title="Photo Of 203 DEntons Green Lane">
 203 Dentons Green Lane</a>, St Helens and it was
their that Robin lived until he started work in 1961.
</p>

<p>
Robin's first went to Rivington Road Infants School St Helens and then to Knowsley Road Junior School.
At the age of 11 he took the 11 plus examination and having passed this went to Cowley Boys Grammar
School where he eventually entered the 6th Form and he took &quot;A&quot; Levels in Maths., Physics and Chemistry.
</p>

<p>
In 1957 Robin left school and went to what was then known as the University College of North
Staffordshire. This is now known as Keele University.
</p>

<p>
Originally Robin intended to take a degree in Chemistry and Physics. 
However in those days the degree course at Keele was a mandatory 4 year course. 
The first year, known as the Foundation Year, was the same for all undergraduates whether
they intended to take 
an Arts, Science or Humanities Degree and consisted of lectures and tutorials in all the subjects covered 
by the courses that Keele offered. As a result of this introduction to new
subjects he changed his mind about studying Physics and took his degree in 
Chemistry and Biology.
</p>

<p>
On Graduating in 1961 Robin joined May &amp; Bakers, a pharmaceutical company at
Dagenham, 
Essex, as a Works Chemist.
</p>

It was while Robin was at May and Bakers that he met
