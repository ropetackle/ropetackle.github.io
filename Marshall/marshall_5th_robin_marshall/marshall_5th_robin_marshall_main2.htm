When Robin and Helen decided to marry they were faced with a problem as to where
they could live.
</p>

<p>
Because of the high cost of housing in the London Area, which was as much a problem in the South East then
as it is now, they could not afford to buy a house there. 
Robin therefore changed jobs, moving to Engelhards, an American firm who manufactured Precious Metal 
chemical compounds, at 

<a

 Cinderford</a> in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire.
</p>

<p>
There they bought a small bungalow, “Maranatha”,

Helen had previously been married to Michael John Simmons and had a daughter,

 Jane</a>, by him. 
When Robin and Helen married they legally adopted Jane as their child.
</p>

<p>
On the 26<sup>th</sup> August 1965 Robin's son,

 Ian David</a>, was born in the Forest of Dean at the 
Dilke Cottage Hospital.
</p>

In 1966 Robin left Engelhards and became a Civil Servant. He joined HM Factory Inspectorate,
which was part of the Ministry of Labour, as a Factory Inspector at their Swindon office. 
The Inspectorate was responsible for the enforcement of Health and Safety at Work Legislation.

<p>
This change of job meant that the family had to move from Cinderford and they moved to a house in the village of

They moved house on the same day that England won the 1966 Soccer World Cup!
</p>

<p>
In 1970, after working in the Inspectorate's Swindon and Bristol Offices, Robin was
transferred to their office in 
Huddersfield and in 1971 the family moved to Yorkshire, settling at 62 Ben Rhydding Road, Ilkley.
</p>

<p>
Various other postings followed but they were able to avoid any further moves of home.
</p>

<p>
Following various promotions Robin worked in Leeds, where he was responsible for training new inspectors 
and subsequently for developing guidance for the asbestos industry on the precautions which should be 
taken to avoid the health risks from that material. 
A spell of three years then followed working at the Bootle Headquarters of the Inspectorate, 
which was by then called the Health and Safety Executive, as, in effect, Personal Assistant to the 
Chief Inspector of Factories.
</p>

<p>
His last posting was to Sheffield where he had national responsibility for advising other inspectors, 
the industries involved and the policy makers in other Government Departments and the European Union on the 
transport of dangerous goods by road and the enforcement and development of legislation to protect the 
public from dangerous industrial activities.
</p>

<p>
In 1996 the chance came for early retirement and he decided to take it, knowing that if he did not he 
would have to carry on working for another 2½ years until the age of 60.
