I wonder how many of the men shown here survived the horrors of World War I - 
they could not have dreamt what they would be facing in a few months time.<br />
Between August 1914 and January 1915 the Battalion lost 261 men out of 1000, a
quarter of its strength. This means that 7 of these 28 men may not have survived
the first 5 months of the War.
