Dad's mother, Elizabeth (Bessy) as a young woman (about 1890?). 
I never knew her - she died in the 1920's before my mother and father married. 
She was an excellent needlewoman and very house proud.
My mother often spoke of how she welcomed her as a prospective daughter-in-law and promised her several 
items of lovely embroidered sheets and clothes and many other household items. 
Unfortunately these went subsequently to Dad's father's second wife, Lily, who was rather hostile to Dad. 
Dad loved his mother very much - tears would come to his eyes when he spoke of her later in life
