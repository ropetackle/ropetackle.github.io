This was taken by Dad in September 1939 and it shows

myself </a> looking on as one of her friends tries on a gas mask. I seem rather
puzzled by what is happening

Dad's comments under the photograph say all that is necessary
</p>

<p align="center">
With the horrors of gas warfare in World War I still fresh in peoples minds, there was real fear 
that the Germans would launch a poisonous gas attack on Britain, particularly in the first 
few weeks of the war. 
All adults were issued with a gas mask like this one. 
When a warning of a gas attack was given you were supposed to put your gas mask on and you would then be, 
hopefully, protected from the gas. 
How effective they would have been I don't know - not very I suspect.
Luckily they never had to be used
</p>
        
<p align="center">
There were special ones for children, known as &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; gas masks - 
because that is who you were supposed to look like when you were wearing it - 
and even tent-like ones for babies! 
You were supposed to carry your gas mask with you at all times. 
Adults carried theirs in canvas bags over their shoulders, children's were in cardboard boxes.
Although as the years went by people became less careful about always having their gas masks with them, 
I remember when I started at infants school having to take my gas mask with me and the teacher showing us 
how to put it on
