Dad took this photograph of the children watching the entertainment at the street party held in the Grove 
to celebrate VE (Victory in Europe) Day in 1945. 
</p>

<p align="center">
When peace was signed between Britain and Germany and the war in Europe ended, 
lots of street parties were held. 
Everybody in the street brought out their best crockery and contributed what food they had managed to save
during the war. 
We had unheard of things to eat - jelly, tinned fruit, cakes with icing, sandwiches with meat in! 
It was a real feast!
It was the first party that anyone had had for at least six years. 
I can't remember what the entertainment was - probably one of the neighbours telling funny stories - 
but whatever it was, we obviously enjoyed it
