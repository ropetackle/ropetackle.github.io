Dad took this photograph of the adults having their tea at the street party held in the Grove to celebrate 
VE (Victory in Europe) day in 1945. 
He was standing on the roof of the air-raid shelter which stood in the middle of the road 
opposite our house
</p>

<p align="Center">  
When peace was signed between Britain and Germany and the war in Europe ended, 
lots of street parties were held.
Everybody in the street brought out their best crockery and contributed what food they had managed to save
during the war. 
We had unheard of things to eat - jelly, tinned fruit, cakes with icing, sandwiches with meat in! 
It was a real feast!
It was the first party that anyone had had for at least six years.
