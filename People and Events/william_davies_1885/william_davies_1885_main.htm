I think this is a lovely picture.

Grandpa Davies</a> stands there, a serious look on his face as he has been told to stand still.
He is wearing his best suit and firmly holds his hat.
Behind him are the studio properties which are meant to convince everyone that he is 
on his family estate.<br />
I think that this was possibly taken in about 1885 when he would have been 5 or 6
