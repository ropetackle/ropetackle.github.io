<p>
Helen is the only child of <a href="test/frame_test.htm" target=_top> Edward John
Kingdon</a>, a Schoolteacher, and <a href="../Tate/tate_4th_marjorie_tate/tate_4th_marjorie_tate_main1.htm"> Marjorie
Tate</a>.
</p>

<p>
She was born on 3<sup>rd</sup> March 1936 in Charing Cross Hospital, London. 
The hospital is within the sound of “Bow Bells” and she is therefore a Cockney.
</p>

<p>
Her father was an Elementary Schoolteacher and her mother had also been a teacher. 
When she was born they were living at <a href="../images/Places/Fullsize/mill_lane.jpg"> 129 Mill
Lane</a>, Chadwell Heath, Essex.
</p>

<p>
Her first child was her daughter Jane Imogen Simmons (Marshall) who was born on 
12<sup>th</sup> February 1960.
</p>

<p>
Helen married Jane’s father, Michael John Simmons at Chelmsford Register Office on the
12<sup>th</sup> March 1960. 
The marriage subsequently broke up and they were divorced, the divorce being made absolute on 
the 17<sup>th</sup> February 1964.
</p>

<p>
After the marriage broke up Helen lived with her parents and Jane at her parents house at 14 Kings Avenue, 
Chadwell Heath, Essex and she started working at May &amp; Bakers, a Chemical Manufacturing Company at 
Dagenham, Essex as a Personnel Assistant. 
It was here that she met Robin Marshall who was employed there as a Works Chemist.
