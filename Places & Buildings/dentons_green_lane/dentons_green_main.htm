Rainford.

I lived here from 1946 until I left University and went to Dagenham. The house
was built in about 1914, in the days when the Middle Class still had a servant
or two. The rooms had bell pushes in them and in the kitchen there was an
indicator board which showed the room to which the servant was summoned.
Needless to say, when we were children the bells did not work. If they had life
would have been hell for Mum. It was big and, in winter, cold. There was no
central heating in those days. Many a winter's morning there was ice on the
inside of the bedroom windows when we woke.

Since we lived there the gate-posts have been removed and the front garden paved
over for car parking.
