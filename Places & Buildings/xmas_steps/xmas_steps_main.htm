Christmas Steps, Bristol</a> is the area of Bristol in which 

<a

title="Alice Louisa Williams Entry" target="_top">
Alice Williams</a>, and possibly her mother 

<a

title="Louisa Williams Entry" target="_top">
Louisa Williams</a>, are believed to have originated.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

Christmas Steps is the name of a narrow pedestrian street in the centre of
Bristol running between Lower Park Row, Lewins Mead and Colston Street. It used
to lead to Christmas Street.
<br />
&nbsp<br />

One theory is that it got its name from Knifesmith Street where the knifesmiths
worked.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />

In the C17<sup>th</sup> the steps were used as a short cut into the centre of
the city from the north bank of the River Frome and in 1669 they were re-stepped by
Jonathan Blackwell, a wealthy wine merchant, because they had become hazardous.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />

At one time they were known as Lunsfords Stairs, after a Royalist Officer of
that name who was killed there during the siege of Bristol in the Civil War.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />

The Steps still exist and its cobbled street is now lined with craft and book
shops. 
It is part of the Bristol tourist trail. 
I am sure it looks a lot different from the days when Alice and Louisa lived there.
