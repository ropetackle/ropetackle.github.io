Grandpa Davies</a> lived.
Grandpa Davies was living here when he died in 1956.

Alan, Brian and myself spent many a happy time here. 
We used to go and visit them almost every Saturday. 
In the garden there was an old pig-sty with a loft above.
This used to make a marvelous den. We used to play for hours in the garden and
in the fields around the house.

Grandpa grew lots of vegetables, raspberries and other soft fruit and we always used to stuff ourselves on
them when they were in season. If you have never eaten a miniature soft brown
bread roll with the centre removed and filled instead with raspberries, you
don't know what good living is!
</p>

<p align="center">
It was fun when you wanted to go to the lavatory.
It was an earth closet in an outhouse attached to the house. To get to it you
had to go into the yard. There was no flushing water and for toilet paper there
were cut up pages of the "News Chronicle" newspaper!
I bet it isn't like that now.

<p align="center">
I can still remember our winter evenings there.
At 5 o'clock we would be sitting by the fire eating the waffles that Grandma used to make on the top of the
kitchen range using an old fashioned waffling iron, and watching Grandpa check his football coupons as the 
results were read out over the radio. 
I don't think he ever won anything, but he always lived in hope.
